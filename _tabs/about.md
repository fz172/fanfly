I am a software engineer by trade. I enjoy flying and currently hold PPL and IFR rating. I learned flying around 2010 and I have been buzzing around ever since.

I currently live in the Bay area, and I am builiding [Sling Tsi](https://www.airplanefactory.com/aircraft/sling-tsi/). This is my blog to track the build progress!

And you can also visit my [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@fanflynorcal?si=xHDwt0aCdQs9oAYJ) for my flight video logs.
