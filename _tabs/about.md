Hi, I am builiding a [Sling Tsi](https://www.airplanefactory.com/aircraft/sling-tsi/). This is my blog to track the build progress!

You can read my written progress update on this site, or check out my [photo album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/oAyhZDqKqAVYoPcz5) for more real time updates.

You can also visit my [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@fanflynorcal?si=xHDwt0aCdQs9oAYJ) for my video build logs.

**Disclaimer**: I am not a professional builder, and this site only documents my experience. Please conduct your own research before taking any of my findiings/learnings into your build experience.
