## TLDR

- Painted the trim of passenger side rear window
- Masked the windshield

## Details

Today my wife Ye came out to the hangar to help. We worked on window painting and attaching the engine. This post focuses on the window work.

Similar to the last window, we taped both the window inside and outside around the trim/edge, and liberally used masking to protect surrounding areas.

The taping required attention to detail, and it took about 2 hours for Ye to complete. After that's done I went ahead and painted the rear window. It came out nicely.

Even though the windshield was also masked, I did not paint it yet because we were working on attaching the engine. So a lot was going on in the area. We decided to prioritize on the engine.

Once the engine is hung and torqued, I will paint the front window.
