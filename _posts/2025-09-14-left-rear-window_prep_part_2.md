## TLDR

- Prepared left rear window for installing

## Details

So today is more grinding on the window. I know most folks building Sling try to fit the window perfectly sized to the frame and glue it with some tools pressing down.

I chose to do something different with my window. I mostly followed this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A336SG-fsiI>

## Drawing lines

Tying a piece of rivet butt on a fine tip marker, I made a tool to draw lines with equal space.

Then I put the rivet butt next to the window frame, and the marker lightly touching the window, and traced around the window. This left a evenly spaced line around my window.

I then used a dremel with cutoff disc to slowly grind off th marked area, and got the window evenly fit within the frame but with about 2mm space to the frame edge.

## Holding the window down

I tried to use ratchet strap and wood pieces to hold the window to the canopy juggle, but some part of the window just doesn't fully stay on the canopy. So I drilled 8 2.4mm holes around the window (but not through the window), and used wingnut clecos to hold the entire window down.

## Taping window edges

After making sure the window fits the canopy and I can hold it down when the Sikaflex cures, I took it off and taped off the edges where I don't want the Sika to get on. And then I cleaned the exposed area with 99% IPO.

I think the window is now ready to be primed and glued on. I ran out of time to actually glue it today. I will probably do it tomorrow or next week.
