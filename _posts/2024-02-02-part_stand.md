## Overview

- Built a shelf similar to the [EAA wing stand](https://www.eaa.org/eaa/aircraft-building/builderresources/while-youre-building/building-articles/tools-and-workshop/how-to-make-a-wing-stand).

## Detail

Today was a easy day. I built a stand to store horizontal stabilizer using some 2x4s.

I bought all my material from Home Depot for about $20.

- 4 pieces, 2 x 4 x 96" wood. I ended up needing only 3 because I already had some 2x4s in my garage from the last project.
- Husky towing strap, rated for 3333 lbs.

I wanted to build a stand roughly about 4 ft long, 2 ft tall. I wanted to have 2 slots to store long pieces: horizontal stabilizer, and the elevator.

So, I measured and cut the wood as the following:

| Length    | Quantity |
| --------- | -------- |
| 44 inches | 3        |
| 24 inches | 8        |

Then I just screwed/wood glued them together. I only built 1 slot for now, because I haven't finished the elevator yet. I will put in the second slot when I need it for the elevator. I then cut 2 short pieces of strap from the husky towing strap and screwed on the shelf. I did not measure the length of the strap to cut, as they didn't need to be very accurate. I just eyeballed the rough length and made sure the 2 strap pieces were of equal length.

As I finished the shelf, I realized the bottom is a good place to store small parts. Maybe I will add a board in a few days to provide some more storage surface.

Lastly, I installed 4 rolling wheels so I can move it around more easily.

With the horizontal stabilizer safely in the shelf, I can finally have my building table back and move on to the next piece ðŸ˜Š
