# TLDR

- Installed Autopilot servos (GSA 28)

# Details

I needed two GSA 28 for autopilot, one of roll and one for pitch.

## Bolts

Installing the bolts and nuts were not fun, as the access is fairly restricted, but can be done. It took me quite a while but eventually I was able to torque all 8 bolts down.

## Rotation stop

The other tricky part is that the Garmin rotation stop is too restrictive for Sling. I needed to grind both the stops down quite a bit to allow enough rotation space. I read this is the case from many other builders, so I just grinded them down before even bolting the servo into place.
