## EAA tech counsel visit

Jason from my EAA chapter came by earlier this week to check out my work. He shared a few tips on solid riveting. In particular, I showed him a smiley face rivet I messed up on the trailing edge of the right wing. We decided that it's not
worth drilling out and redo, because there is a chance I'd make the situation worse. That sounds good to me. I will probably leave it along.

We discussed painting and priming. One thing I've always confused is that why I need to scuff the inner material if I don't prime. The probable answer is that I don't need to. Scuffing will increase the surface area. Even though the material (6061-T6) is corrosion resistent, but there is no reason to increase the chance for corrosion. So I will stop scuffing internal parts going forward. I will just clean with either acetone of alcohol and wipe them off.

We also discussed wire planning. For example, I used a 4.8 rivet on an adel clamp to secure the wiring for pitot tube. It would be easier to service if I have used a rivnut. That's a good point. I will think about servicibility in the future for parts in close quarters.

## Landing lights

The back ordered landing light and wing tips arrived this week. I finally have all the parts to fully close the wing.

Last night I spent an hour or so to connect the landing and taxi lights.

The kit came with bullet terminal. I replaced with heatshrink ring terminal to fit the screws on the lights.

I did not find the spring particularly difficult to install to the wing ribs, probably because I have not installed rib 14 yet, so there was a lot of space for me to wiggle around. The wiring was pretty straightforward. I tested with 12v battery and they worked.

## Left skin closed

After checking everything looked good, I closed the top skin on the left wing. It's a super tedious process, but nothing difficult. It took me about 3-4 hours to finish the job. The wing root and tip are still balanced and aligned before and after riveting.
