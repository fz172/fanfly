## TLDR

- Riveted left bottom skin

## Details

The riveting process was tedious pretty standard. Most rivets aligned perfectly. Towards the outboard section a few holes needed to be match drilled.

### Oil canning

Near the center section (rib 7), the skin had some oil canning. I noticed that when the skin pops in/out, the rib moves with it. I wonder if the situation will improve after I have the top skin. I will experiment with it when attaching the top skin.

### Zip tie securing the wire harness

Before riveting the center stringer, I put some zip tie through the pre-drilled holes on the stringer to secure the harness. This provided a little more space between the harness wire and the rivet butt from the skin.

_Note the zip ties along the stringer. They are not tied yet. The slight tension by inserting the zie tie is sufficient to keep the wire away from the skin rivets. The zip tie is closed when all riveting is done._
