## TLDR

- Installed the windshield

## Details

With the experience from installing all the other windows, installing the windshield wasn't that difficult.

Even though not difficult, it was a lot of work spread out over the entire weekend. It followed roughly the same sequence as before:

- Measure & rough cut
- Test fit & fine tune
- Cleaning & Prepping
- Priming, Gluing, curing

### Measuring & Rough Cut

Before drawing lines around the windshield, I marked centerline of the center fuselage, and the center of the acrylic glass. Then for the rest of the work, I made sure the centerline of the fuselage and glass always aligned.

Then I drew a line around the canopy juggle on the glass for the rough shape. Before cutting, the window could not sit flush within the juggle. It's at least 1 inch above. So the line drawn was very rough.

For the first cut, I focused on the lower section. My plan is to first make the lower section sit into the juggle, then I can re-measure the sides and top more accurately.

And after the lower section and the sides were cut, I put the windshield back onto the airplane and re-drew the top line.

_You can see there are a lot of extra material I needed to cut away_

### Fine tuning

There was lot of putting the window on, making marks, removing it, do some little cut/sanding.

### Taping and Prepping

Once the window fit perfectly, I used a few clamps to secure it in place, and taped around it with vinyl tapes and blue painter tapes.

Then I gave the entire surface a thorough clean before wrapping the window in a big film for protection.

I also tested to use a ratcheting strap to put some pressure on the windshield. This was required to entire the curvature aligns ok and the window fully presses on the glue later.

### Priming and Gluing

Then everything was taken off to apply the Sika products.

Today I removed the tapes around the windshield to see the final effect. I also used a razor knife to shave off the extras overflown around the juggle.
