## TLDR

- Installed control stick on the pilot side

## Detail

This is probably the first piece of avionic that I had some serious work on.

I installed the control stick on the pilot side, including depinning the CPC connector, feed the wire through, connecting the elevator pushrod, re-pinning the connector, test movements.

### Depinning the connector

In order to feed the wire through the control stick tube, I must depin the CPC connector first. Midwest Panel Builder sent me the depin tool, which I used to remove the connector.

### Feeding the wire

Once the connectors are off, getting the wire through the control stick is trivial.

### Elevator pushrod

After the wire is in place, I connected the elevator pushrod and made sure a full range of movement can be made without tugging the wire.

### Reconnecting the CPC connector

See picture above.

I actually think I might have done this differently from wht MPB had in mind. I am guessing the intention is to have the connector outside of the control stick box, and the harness will be attached to the box wall. The whole connection will be on the outside for easy removal if needed.

I connected the CPC on the inside. Since the wire is long enough for a full range of motion, and I have tested continuity of each wire, I did not want to take it apart and do it over. If there is a need to remove the control stick, I think I will just cut the wire and make an extension when that happens.

### Copilot side

I was unable to do the same to the copilot side, because one pin refused to come out when I was trying to depin the connector.

I had to cut that one wire. But it means I need to get a set of new pins and a new CPC connector. I that all that stuff on order. Once they arrive I guess I will have to do that additional work.
