### TLDR

- Prepped all parts for trim sub-assembly
- Installed trim on elelvator

### Details

The replacement part (the piano hinge) arrived a few days ago. I put the trim sub-assembly together and installed on the elevator.

The new piano hinge lines up with the trim skin much better than the previous one (although still needed some match drilling). I cleaned and deburred the parts, did a test fit and riveted them together. And same as last week, I drilled holes for safety wire on both ends of the hinge to prevent the steel rod ever sliding out.

On the top side of the skin, the standard length 3.2mm rivets did not fit, so I used the shortened ones that I previously modified.

Then I clecoed the trim to elevator to test straightness, did not see any problems there. After the test, I riveted the trim onto the elevator assembly.

## Video

The trim is the last piece of the sub-assemblies on the elevator. Minus a few minor things (installing trim motor to the mount, connecting the wire to avionics) I am done with the elevator hardware.

Here is a video blog entry for the overall work.
