## TLDR

- Connected engine harness for fusebox
- Connected engine harness for starter

## Details

### Fusebox

There were 5 big connectors for the fusebox, and a BUNCH grounding wires.

The 5 big ones are: fusebox A, fusebox B, X3, regulator B, regulator A.

There are 9 small wires, all need to be grounded to the regulator A plate (EMS ground).

And there are 2 more wires from the Midwest Panel harness that also need to be ground to regulator A.

So, in total I had 11 grounding wires all going to the 3 terminals on regulator A. I split them into 3 grounds, and torqued the little M4 screw to 11 in-lb per the Rotax installation manual.

### Starter Relay

On the harness, there were 2 wires for the starter relay. The spade connector went to the receptacle on the relay itself. And the ring terminal ground wire went to under the mounting bolt so it was connected to the relay's shell.
