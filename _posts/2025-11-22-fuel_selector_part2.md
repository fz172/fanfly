## TLDR

- Installed fuel selector to dashboard
- Connected fuel lines to fuel selector

## Details

### Test Fitting the Fuel Selector

Followed the video instruction for installing the fuel selector. The installation required sandwiching a circuit board between the fuel sector and a doubler plate. The circuit board is required to detect the fuel selector position in order to command the boost pump.

The fuel selector will be very difficult to reposition once connected to the fuel lines, so I took some time to try rotating the fuel selector into different angles with the fuel line AN6 fittings loosely connected.

### AN6 Fuel lines

Once the fuel selector/fuel line combo fit under the dashboard without much forcing, I tightened the fittings one by one.

### Fuel Selector Final Assembly

Then I installed the final 4 screws that locks the fuel selector into final location.

### Problem with Routing

The only remaining problem is I cannot route the fuel line in a nice way. Ideally I want the lines to go between the center channel, but it's too long too rigid. And the fuel selector's fitting already protrudes outside of the channel. There is no way I can tug the lines back into the channel as is.

I will need to manipulate the lines creatively somehow next time I work on the build. The most important aspects are:

1. They need to be secure
2. Don't rub against each other
3. Don't rub against any wires
4. Don't interfere with passenger's legs.
5. Don't interfere with rudder pedal.
