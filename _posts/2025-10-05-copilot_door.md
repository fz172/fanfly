## TLDR

- Completed the copilot side door window

## Details

The process is exactly the same as pilot door. I thought it would go faster but I ended up spending roughly the same amount of time (8 hours over 3 days).

### Cutting

First did a rough cut to trim the extra acrylic window around the canopy juggle. Then used the 2" flap wheel on a die grinder to fine tune the edges.

### Taping

Spent way more than I expected to tape around the edge on both sides of the window as well as the canopy.

Spoiler alert: I still managed to get the black glue all over the door! Easy enough to wipe off with 99% alcohol though.

### Sika

Applied 205 -> 209 -> 295 UV.

I put too little 295 initially. When I clamped the window and canopy together I did not see a whole lot of squeeze out around the window. So I took the window off and applied 295 more liberally. Then the glue squeezed out and filled gaps around the window/canopy.

### Finishing

Lastly, I waited overnight for the 295 glue to set. Then I used a craft knift to shave off the extra glue that went over the flat surface of the window/canopy to make it look nicer. It's mostly flat with a few bumps. I think using a 220 grit sand paper will be easier than the knife to make them all flat. Since I am planning to spray a layer of primer on top of the glued area, I will have to sand around the edge anyway. So I am calling the work done at this point :)
