# TLDR

- Routed 2 cannon plugs (RE1/RE2) to the firewall


# Details

This is again unplanned work. I almost forgot I needed to route these 2 plugs until I watched an youtube video from another builder,

So anyways, I connected the 2 connectors to the firewall. There are already 2 cutouts waiting for the connectors, so I didn't have to do any cutting work. I enlarged the screw holes a little and secured the 2 plugs using M5 self-tapping screws.

The wire to the connectors were not too difficult to route. The only thing is that the wire touches the back of the rack slightly. To prevent chaffing, I wrapped the wire with some silicone tape, and also glued some edge protector on the rack.
