## TLDR

- Connected most wires around the battery in the firewall forward

## Details

I spent most of the day today to build the battery cables with #2 gauge wire and connect them in the firewall forward section.

One thing I didn't think is that it takes #tremendous amount of force to close the battery lug crimp. As a skinny asian person body strength is not really my strong suite lol.

So anyways, I managed to crimp the wires between the battery, the fusebox, master solenoid, and the harness. I left out the cables for starter since I don't have the engine parts yet.

Once I made the first cable, I learned the process so the rest was not so hard. I basically measured an cut the wires, then crimped one end, then test fit the wire and "clock" the wire and battery lug on the other end, then finally finish the crimping.

### Battery ground

One last wire I haven't connected is this #12 gauge battery ground. This is not the lug from battery negative pole. That one are already connected to the airframe.

I think this one should also go to the air frame for grounding. I am not sure if it can be anywhere on the air frame or has to be the same place where the battery lug are grounded. I plan to just put a new hole near this wire and connect it with a AN4 bolt.
