## TLDR

- Installed and tested nav/strobe light on the left wing

## Details

I first prepared the 4 wires coming out of the nav light, as well as the 4 wires from wing harness. They will be connected together using heat shrink connectors.

The wiring on the left nav light is identical to the right side.

| PIN    | Color  |
| ------ | ------ |
| Ground | Black  |
| Nav    | Red    |
| Strobe | Yellow |
| Sync   | Green  |

I connected the wires between wing wire harness to the lights, then tested with a 9v battery. They work!

_Testing with battery_

After that, I installed the light onto the wing, and locked it in place with an allen key.
