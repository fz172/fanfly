## TLDR

- Installed a new set of door handles

## Details

I previously already installed a set of door handles towards the rear side of the door. The other day when I was sitting inthe cockpit and trying things out, the handle position was not comfortable to pull.

So I bought two new handles from Sling, and installed them towards the front side of the door.

The process is basically the same as before. I measured the distance between the two screw hole positions, and drilled the door to install the handles with 2 screws.

The only thing is, I have already installed the window, so I had no choice but to drill through the edge of the window for the screws to go through.

Easy fix though. I will buy a small tube of Sika 295, and fill the hole.
