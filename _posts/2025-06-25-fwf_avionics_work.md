# TLDR

- Started wiring on the firewall forward

# Details

I started to do the wiring on the firewall forward.

This part is a little slow, because most of the wire (not many fortunately) required some work, either crimping a connector or making my own wire. So I needed to constantly refer back to the wire diagram to understand what each wire was.

## Temporary battery box

The battery box usually comes with the FWF kit (I think). I haven't received my kit yet, so I made my own temporary battery box just so I can continue on the wiring job.
