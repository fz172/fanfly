## Tasks Completed

- Elevator bottom skin 95% complete
- built a laser level jig and verfied elevator striaigtness
- Trim motor nutplate installed

## Elevator bottom

Yesterday I used a rivet to test each hole on the bottom side of the skin. Only a few holes needed to ream. I did that and removed all clecos on the bottom side to vacuum the dust.

Then I put the clecos back and pushed each quadrant of the skin to check ripple. There was no oil canning at all. Super!

I then started to rivet on the bottom skin on both left/right sides. I followed the same squence as when I did the clecoing - main spar first, then trailing edge, then in the middle. It was a tediuous process, but went smoothly.

On the right side, a few rivet could not be installed yet because the surface is so thin that the rivets were too long. I marked them on the skin using a marker, and will need to shorten a few rivets to fully finish the bottom side.

## Measuring straightness

Even though 99% of the holes lined up during riveting, I still want to measure the straightness just to verify.

The table placing the elevator is not 100% level, so I needed to put my laser in manual mode. However my laser level is weird - when put it manual mode, the lines it shoots is about 10 degrees rotated. So I need a way to line up the laser line and horizontal axis of the elevator. I tried to manually hold the laser first. With patience, I was able to get an OK measurement. But obviously this isn't scalable, I don't want to do this to every part I am going to build next.

I decided to build a simple jig: I first used 2 flat wood board to build a T shape as stand. Then screwed a third piece of wood onto the T stand near the center. This will be the platform to put the laser. I only used a single screw intentionally so the platform can rotate. The whole thing took about 5 minutes and the finak effect is pretty successful. I was able to measure the straightness much more easily.

## Trim motor hardware

I also workwd on the trim motor (just to hardware part, no wiring).

The main work here is to install 4 nutplates to the trim motor so it can be screwed onto the elevator. Not all holes are pre-drilled so some holes had to be manufactured.

The instruction was pretty clear, I pretty much just followed it:

1. clecoed the motor onto the elevator to match holes
2. upsized the four 3.2mm holes to 4mm
3. unclecoed, and screwed M4 machine screw through the hole with nutplate in place
4. drilled 2.4mm holes using nutplate as a template
5. countersunk the 2.4mm holes
6. installed countersink rivets

That's pretty much it. I took extra care when drilling holes since the process was not reversible. But in the end the final product looked good.
