## TLDR

- Test fitted and drilled rivet holes on the canopy

## Detail

### Fitting

To test fit the canopy, I got help from my dad and we put the canopy on the fuselage back and forth quite a few times.

The main issue with the canopy fitting is that the right side parachute cable touched the fuselage, and created a huge gap between the canopy and the side skin.

So each time I test fitted the canopy I noted the size of the gap, and enlarged the cutout slot on the fuselage to let the parachute cable pass better. After 3 or 4 times it finally went through with some clearance, and the side skin was able to fit with no gap.

And another thing is that the lip on both sides seems to be too small. Other builders had to trim the side lips to let the canopy fully sit in the fuselage, but mine already sinks into the fuselage. I actually have to lift it a few millimeters to make the lip sit flush with the top of fuselage.

### Drilling

So after trimming the few spots to make the canopy sit perfectly in the canopy, I started the drilling process.

I first drilled a few holes at the very front of the canopy, and the most rear end as well. The hope is this should lock the canopy in place. Then I drilled everything in between.

I drilled the holes connecting with the rear fuselage the last. It had some gap between the canopy and the skin, so after putting on cleco it was pulling the skin down a little bit. But it's not too bad, I can't tell any bulge looking from 2 feet away. I don't think this will affect anything during flight.

### Cleaning and prepping for connection

After everything was drilled, I had to take them apart one last time. I vacuumed the space thoroughly, and used acetone to wipe the skin and the canopy lip to remove grease/oil/dust.

Since the Sikaflex hasn't arrived yet, I can't connect the canopy just yet. Hopefully I can get the glue and finally install it next week.
