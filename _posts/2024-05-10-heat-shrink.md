## Task completed

- Test fitted a few different size heat shrink

### Details

I have been waiting for my wing kit to arrive, and today I noticed the labels I attached to some of my wires went loose.

Learning: label printer's label does not work. They won't stick for long.

I measured the diameter of my wires, and came up with a game plan. I think I will get some 1/16 and 3/32 clear heat shrink to wrap around my labels. Hopefully the 2 different size heat shrink will fit 18awg and 22awg wires fine. Then the heat shrink will keep the labels in place.

I also test fitted putting a wire protector around the cable, and use a 1/4 heat shrink to hold the protector. That worked out perfectly.

So I think I will do this to all my wires next.

## Misc: Hangar

Oh another thing that happened when I wait for the wing kit, I got a hangar!

I received the phone call from KRHV a couple of weeks ago for a T-hangar. I immediately signed up when they called.

Funny enough they called me the next week asking me if I want to take a hangar in E16. I was torn.. E16 can conduct first flight but RHV cannot. RHV is so much closer though. Considering San Jose is trying to close down RHV, I ended up taking E16.

I will probably get a nest cam or something and bring to the hangar next week.
