# TLDR

- Fixed GMU11 connection
- Dissembled the instrument panel

# Detail

## GMU11

During the first power on I could not get GMU11 data. By asking Midwest Panel Builders, they suggested to check power and ground.

I took apart the connector and indeed the power were wired to the incorrect pin. 

I tried to extract the pins but it was too difficult, so I just cut the wires and repined with new parts from aircraft spruce. This time I double checked the pins are where they supposed to be. 

When putting the connector back, a small gotcha was that the flat side of the strain relief need to face the wire. Otherwise the sharp side  will cut through the wire over time.

Then I powered on the panel again. This time, it doesn't say "Magnetometer power supply fault". Instead it says "Magnetometer not calibrated". So that's good. It's able to power the GMU11 and knows it's not calibrated.

## Power off

After that, I started to take apart the panel. I need to get the panel off for a few reasons.

1. I need to install the top skin first. With the panel and dashboard on, I cannot do that.
2. During the first install, I noticed a few wires are rubber some metal parts of the panel and at least one coax were too long.

After taking the panel off, I readjusted the wires and made the GNX375 coax about 3 inches shorter.
