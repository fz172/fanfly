# TLDR

- Test fitted the throttle quadrant
- Tested flap motor

# Details

## Throttle quadrant

So once the temporary center console & skins are in place, I placed the throttle quadrant to test fit. 

The brake line has tiny clearance with the flap motor, I was almost certain they will touch if the motor moved. So I decided to do a power up test on the flap motor.

## Testing the flap motor

So I disconnected the PR1 harness connector, found pin 10 and 11, then put 12V power over the 2 pins. 

The motor moved to top, and I used this position to redo the brake line routing to create enough clearance

## Back to throttle quadrant

I needed to disconnect the brake line and re-clock the connector position in order to connect the quadrant and the brake lines without touching the flap motor. Eventually I got it done.
