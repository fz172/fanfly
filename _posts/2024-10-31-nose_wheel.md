## TLDR

- Assembled the nose wheel
- Built the front gear fork

## Details

### Nose wheel

The inner tube had a L shape valve that needs to go through the rim. I spent a whole evening trying to figure out how to get it through.

In the end I hammered out the Y shape thing on the rim to insert the tube value, and hammered the Y shape thing back.

The rest was easy. The torque on the bolts are 11.3 Nm for future reference.

I haven't looked at the main wheels yet, but I assume they will both be done the same way.

### Front gear fork

The structure of the fork is straightforward. It only takes 10 bolts to put the 4 main pieces together. However every bolt is extremely tight fit. Again, this took me a good 2 hours to get it done.
