## TLDR

- Built a bunch of connectors for various sensors
  - Absolute pressure sensor
  - Differential pressure sensor
  - Fuel pump
- Mounted the PCV (pressure control valve)

## Details

While Ye and Amy worked on the rivet filling, I continued to work on the engine harness.

### Absolute Pressure Sensor

Used a 4-pin Delphi 150 connector for the absolute pressure sensor.

There are 3 pins:

- Pin 1: White
- Pin 2: Blue
- Pin 3: Yellow

### Differential Pressure Sensor

Also 4-pin Delphi 150 connector for the differential pressure sensor. This one needs all 4 pins.

- Pin 1: White
- Pin 2: Blue
- Pin 3: Yellow
- Pin 4: Ground shield wire

For the ground shield wire, I used a solder sleeve to connect it to the connector.

### PCV

The PCV is mounted on the firewall. I previously installed the M4 rivnuts for the PCV so it's just a matter to routing the valve to the firewall.

The rubber tubes are pretty long. The tube on the yellow value in particular had a bit interference with engine mount.

I cut the ear clamb and detached the tube connecting to the turbo, routed it under the engine mount, then re-attached it to the valve with a new ear clamp. I haven't cut a ear clamp before. It's not that hard to cut it but had to be done carefully to avoid damaging the tube or the turbo.

### Fuel Pump

The fuel pump just had 2 lugs for ring terminals. But the rotax harness has a delphi style connector. It was a real homework to figure out what connector to use on the fuel pump side so they can connect together.

_Rotax harness connector for fuel pump_

The female connector is from delphi, part number _12162017_

The male connector can be found from Mouser, part number _15339016_. Here are the product links for the connector, pins, and seals:

- Connector: https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/829-15339016
- Pins: https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/829-12045773
- Seals: https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/829-15324976

With the right tools, it's pretty easy to build the connector.

But before the connector, I had to deroute a bit and change the fuel pump wires. I previously connected 12AWG wires, but the connector is designed for 14 AWG. Since the fuel pump does not require 12awg wire, so I replaced it with 14AWG wire.

I ran out of time to do the other fuel pump connector. I will finish it next week.
