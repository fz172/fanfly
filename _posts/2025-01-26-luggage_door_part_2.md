# TLDR

- Installed the luggage door

# Detail

As one of the last few things on the rear fuselage, I finished installing the luggage door.

Last time when I was test fitting the piano hinge didn't really align. I must have fitted it wrong, because this time it aligns perfectly.

I didn't need to do any match drill, the high and door connected very smoothly. So I just riveted them together.
