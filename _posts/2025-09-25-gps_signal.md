## TLDR

- Checked GPS Antenna (GA35) Installation

## Details

Work has been super busy lately. After work today I managed to find 15 minutes to work on the airplane.

My GNX 375 has been saying "No GPS Position" and I've been worried if there is any issue with my anntena. So with the 15 minutes I had I decided to pull the airplane out of the hangar and power it on for a test.

I didn't even need to fully pull it out. As I moved the airplane closer to the gate, the GPS Status page picked 2 satellites, that's a good enough signal for me to know the GA35 is installed correctly. A good use of 15 minutes :)
