# TLDR

- Did the Rotax engine training with Motive.aero


# Details

This week I went to Petaluma to attend some trainings on servicing the Rotax engine. The training school is Motive.areo and they offer a lot of classes. I signed up for service rating, maintenance rating, and the installation class. The goal is to learn as much about the engine as possible before the actual installation.

The week started with the 2 day service rating class. We did some class lecturing, spent quite a lot of time working on a real engine. We did oil change, practiced burping, purging, carburetor synchronization, and a few other things.

The 3rd and 4th day were focused on line maintenance. Besides the lecture time, we spent one day to take down the entire 912 engine, and the other day to put it back together. It was super fun!

The last day (today) was the installation class. We basically rediscussed the systems similar to the service class but focusing more on the installation side. For example, they talked about where exactly AAPT should be placed, where to locate the various sensors etc.

At the end of this long week, I am way more confident than before. I can at least tell identify the components on the engine (kinda). How many opportunities do you get to take apart a whole engine and put it back together?!? 

And besides, I got to meet a bunch of interesting people! I got to meet Edward, Sasha & Peter, Kevin, David and many other friends, old and new. 1/3 of the class are building Sling as it turns out. It's one big community :)
