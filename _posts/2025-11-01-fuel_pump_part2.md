## TLDR

- Wired the Rotax fuel pumps
- Installed the fuel pump assembly to firewall

## Details

### Wiring

Each of the 2 fuel pumps needs 2 wires(power and ground). So I cut a few pieces wires and crimped them with ring terminal. As I said in my last build log, I am slightly worried the terminals might be a little difficult to access once the pumps are installed, so I installed the wires to the pumps before putting them on the firewall.

### Installing on the firewall

The unit is attached to the firewall with 4 steel zipties. This is the first time I work with metal ziptie. It's really difficult to tighten by hand. I think I will have to cut them and redo once I buy a ziptie tool from Amazon.

Then the other part of the installation is to connect the fuel lines. Since I'm using the PTFE lines from Aerospace Innovations, the lines are pre-made to length. So this part did not take much effort at all.
