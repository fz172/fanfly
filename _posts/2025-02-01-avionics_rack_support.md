## TLDR

- Made some support angle for the avionics rack

## Detail

I test fitted the avionics rack and made some support angle for it.

I bought the raw aluminum angle material from Home Depot. Measured and cut to size, then drilled a few 4.0mm holes for later use. I will buy some M4 locknut to connect the angle and rack for easy access. I imagine I will need to take it down often for future inspection.
