# TLDR

- Tried to fit luggage floor skin but couldn't make it fit

# Details

I am working on Tsi fuselage KAI's page 29-30 installing the luggage floor. I clecoed support channels and the floor to test fit, however I'm running into a problem with the floor skin's flange on both sides (please see picture).

Basically as I cleoco them together, I have a 3mm gap between the floor skin's flange and the longeron on both sides. The gap runs across the entire length of the floor flange. I checked the floor sits fully on the support channels and there is nothing interfering below the floor skin. I also tried to cleco the floor onto the flange to bring the gap closer, but the floor flange just bends and distorts.

It almost seems like I'm missing a doubler or I need a shallower flange or something, but I don't see any mention of doublers on the KAI.

I sent a question to Sling technical and still waiting for them to respond.

My thinking is I will either:

1. Get a replacement part
2. Make some shim
