# TLDR

- Installed horizontal stabilizer

# Detail

Last few weeks I was fully stuck on debugging the audio jack. With most of the issues figured out, I decided to work on something easy to make myself feel better :)

So I installed the horizontal stabilizer.

The process is really straightforward. The bolts were easily accessible. I put on the HS and bolted it onto the rear fuselage with 8 AN3 bolts. Then I set the torque seal. Done.
