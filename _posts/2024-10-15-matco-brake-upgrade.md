## TLDR

- Replaced stock brake with Matco dual piston brake system

## Details

I ordered Matco dual piston brake system upgrade and the assemblies arrived a few days ago.

Today I got a chance to inspect the new system and swap out the old one.

The new disc is a lot thicker, and obviously it comes with 2 pistons on each brake. I think it will be a very good upgrade once completed.

The swap process is trivial. I didn't fully install them back onto the wheel because I still need to install the wheel first.
