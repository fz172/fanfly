## TLDR

- Skin prep
- Inspection hatch

## Parts prep

### Skin

There is no dimple on the elevator, so the prep is pretty straightforward. As painful as always, I peeled off the plastic cover from both skins. This is probably the most time consuming part of this build log entry ðŸ˜¢

I wiped down the skin for dust, then deburred all holes and edges. I then used maroon scotch brite to scoff up the skin near all the holes to make future painting easier.

### priming other parts

Then I moved onto priming a few smaller parts, namely: the tiny doublers that need to go between rib and skin, and the parts for inspection hatch.

I only primed one side of the round piece, which is the inspection hatch cover under the elevator.

On the unprimed side, I followed the Sling instruction to put on a layer of vinyl. I probably don't need the prime on either side actually, because I assume the primer will be replaced by something else before painting the airplane. But it doesn't hurt to keep the prime on for now to get some protection.

## Inspection hatch

### Grip on plate

For some reason, the 3.2mm rivet holes on the inspection hatch are all pre-drilled to 2.8mm. So I needed to updrill them to 3.2. Not a big deal, done.

Then I riveted the inspection hatch grip on plate on the inside of the left skin.

I wanted to do this as early as possible before I install the skin because the skin is really flimsy and I was worried I might accidentally give it a bend or something. Adding the plate gives it a tiny bit more strength.

## Inspection cover

The holes on the cover is also pre-drilled to 2.8 and I upsized them to 3.2mm per the instruction. Not sure why they didn't just pre-drill to 3.2mm like other parts that came in the kit.

Then riveting and installing a M4 nut.

The KAI called for 6 rivets but there are 8 holes. The 2 holes left without rivet are used to provide a insert to some kind of tool to help rotate the plate more easily. I don't like the idea of leaving holes unriveted. So I riveted all 8 holes. When I need to rotate, I can put 2 mandrels in the rivet hole, or use a suction cup.
