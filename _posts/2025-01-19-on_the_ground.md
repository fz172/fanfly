## TLDR

- Moved the airplane to stand on the ground

## Detail

## Lowering the wheel to a ramp

Today my friend Daniel came over. I asked if he could help me move the airplane off the table, and so we got it done.

The airplane was super light, but it's bulky. We carefully moved the plane around, tried to pull a table, put it back it, pull another one, etc. Eventually the two main wheels were lowered to a set of car ramp, and we pushed it down the the ground.

The only gotcha is that the plane was very tail heavy right now, so we put a sawhorse and a work table under the tail to hold it.

### Removing temporary stiffeners

And once it's on the ground, I happily removed the temp stiffeners that was supposed to hold the fuselage shape.

Now I will have some space to work on the internals.
