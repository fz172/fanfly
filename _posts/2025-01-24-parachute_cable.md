# TLDR

- Bolted the rear parachute cable

# Detail

It took me two whole nights to bolt on the rear parachute cable.

The fitting was easy. The rear parachute cable went through the side skin channels and sat into the rear spar no problem.

But inserting the M10 bolt to secure the cable was a super painful. The bolt just didn't want to fully go through the spar. I think it's because the cable was pushing the bolt just by a hair, so it misaligned with the spar.

It took me several tries to let the bolt catch the spar hole, and eventually I was able to thread the two bolts on each side and finally lock down the parachute cable.

## Problematic rivet

However, as can be seen from the picture, one rivet cannot be inserted as the cable was blocking it from behind.

I sent a question to technical and turns out I will have to safely drill the hole as much as possible, then shorten the rivet to complete this section of the build.
