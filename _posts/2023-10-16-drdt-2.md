I ordered a DRDT-2 from [Cleveland Aircrat tools](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/products/compression-type-dimpling-tool?_pos=1&_sid=4b7447b08&_ss=r) last week, and it arrived today.

To my surprise, it requires assembly :) I guess it makes sense, but I was not expecting it for some reason. So it became a fun little project for me in the evening.

I cannot say the instruction was good. A lot of the part numbers were abbreviated, and some screws drawn on assembly diagram was not labeled. It took me a little guessing to figure out what screw/nuts/washers to use for each piece. But overall the process wasn't too bad. It took less than an hour to finish the whole thing.


Here is the finished product. It' HEAVY! Next step, I will make a small table or cart to put this thing.
