# TLDR

- Prepped the top rear fuselage top skin
- Clecoed the left half

# Details

Per normal practise, I deburred, scoffed and cleaned the top skin for the rear fuselage.

I sent an email to MPB to see if I need to wait until panel wiring is in place. Steve from MPB said it's fine to install top skin now as long as the coaxial cable is installed.

So after I secured the coax cables (a few days ago), I clecoed the left side of the skin.

I didn't cleco both sides because I ran out of clecos, and also because I didn't want to fully close the top just in case I need access for whatever reason.
