## Rivet filling

Amy decided to help, so we turned to rivet filling as a little weekend project.

We mixed 3 grams of Super-fil (I used this opportunity to teach her how to read scale). And I let her do most of the filling.

She would fill a hole, I then wipe the excessive with a paper towel. At the end I re-filled a few bad holes, and I cleaned the surface with acetone.

We were able to get through half of the left side fuselage skin. Not bad for a weekend kid project.

## Countersinking seat rails

Another thing I did was that I countersunk all the holes on the seat rail as part of the center console.

The instruction said I need to use 4.8mm countersink rivets of 3 holes on each rail in particular.

But it didn't mention what rivet I needed to use for any other hole. Given that the seat will move along the hole rail, I decided to countersink the whole thing.

Very tedious, but not difficult. It took me a while to get everything done and test fitted.

## Un-assembling the throttle quadrant

I also un-assembled the throttle quadrant.

I previously primed the quadrant panel to be white and thought I could just use it without painting. But I noticed the primer is really good at collecting dust and dirt.

So I took it apart and will paint it with my next batch of paint job.

I also ordered the PTEF custom brake lines from FS Flightlines to replace the nylon brake lines for better safety. I will keep the throttle quadrant open and install the new lines when they arrive in a couple of weeks.
