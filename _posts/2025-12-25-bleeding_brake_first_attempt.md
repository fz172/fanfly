## TLDR

- Tried to bleed the brake but stopped

## Details

I don't have pictures for this entry because my hands were full of brake fluid and everywhere was a mess in my hangar post the brake bleeding attempt.

After the throttle quadrant was installed, I started the process to bleed the brake.

The thinking is I would follow what everyone else did:

1. Close parking brake, open both bleeding valves.
2. Push blake fluid in a syringe from one side until it comes out from the other side.
3. Do it from the other side.
4. Open parking brake, push fluid to reservoir and test brake action.

Unfortunately I had to stop on the second step.

What I did not anticipate is that it takes a lot of force to push the fluid into the bleeding valve. The big syringe and the tubes I bought were not a great fit for the bleeding valve. It leaked when I added pressure on the syringe.

So between manipulating the syringe and the tube, I managed to get some fluid to come out from the bleed valve on the other wheel, at the cost of dropping braking fluids all over the floor. And after doing this for 1.5 hours, I was exhausted so I called it a day.

Before I try this again, I plan to buy something that helps me pump the fluid, some kind of pump maybe.
