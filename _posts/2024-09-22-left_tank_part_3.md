## Leak test

After waiting for 1 week since I sealted back channel, I started pressure testing to check for leaks.

I pumped the tank to 1.0 PSI air at 3pm on Saturday. I know the pressure will go up a little as the day gets hottest by 4pm.

Indeed the pressure gauge needle moved up a tiny but didn't make a significant difference.

I tracked the temperature, time and pressure for 24 hours, and logged the follow chart.

In a 24 hour cycle, the pressure started at 1PSI and came back to 1 PSI. In addition, the pressure held at 1PSI at the initial 3 hours. I think I can declare the tank is leak free at this point.
