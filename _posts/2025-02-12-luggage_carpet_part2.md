- Installed the leather on center console

# Detail

## Luggage area

Not much to report. I continued to carpet the luggage area. Some parts fits the area really good, but some parts required significant trimming.

The barge cement is really good! I applied the glue to both the carpet and the metal surface, then slapped them together. The carpet holds really well.

The glue instruction says I need to wait 5 minutes to 4 hours before putting the parts together, or something like that. I didn't really need to wait any time at all. Each time I finished applying the glue to carpet side, the metal side was pretty much dry. So I didn't spend any time waiting for anything to dry. So far, nothing has fallen off yet.

## Luggage door

I glued 16-A and 16-B near the luggage door, but I had to take them off.

The luggage door has a significant gap once locked. I am weighing my options. Someone bent the locking plate, which sounds good to me. And someone (Midwest Sports I believe) recommends a kind of sealing rubber around the luggage door. I think that's also a good idea. And it will also provide some weather proof.

So I ordered the rubber seal from McMaster. I will have to install the rubber seal first, then the carpet. I think the rubber will take some space on the luggage door. If I still see gaps, then I will consider my other options on the locking plate again. I am not keep to bend it, I might add a spacer plate instead if needed.

## Center Console

I followed Evan's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoBYTvSrca8&list=PLQcGDbAAIZb00QsNn6om0xTirTiVaLn3h&index=16) exactly on putting on the leather for the center console. There were no surprises, but took some artistic work. I'm not an artist, so the outcome has some flaws. But I'm also not an perfectionist, I am pretty happy with the end result.
