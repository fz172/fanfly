# TLDR

- Made a shim to fill landing gear gap (left side)

# Detail

My landing gear has a 1.0mm gap on the left side, so I needed to make a shim to fill the gap before torquing down the landing gear.

## Step1: made a shape template

I placed a card board inside the cockpit on the other side of the landing gear bolt insert. Then I traced the shape of the shim I needed to make.

To locate the hole for the bolt, I put some torquing seal on the 2 M10 bolts, and then pressed the card board on the bolt. It left a trace of the bolt print, and I cut the 10mm holes on the painted location.

I then test fitted the card board template, it seemed to work.
