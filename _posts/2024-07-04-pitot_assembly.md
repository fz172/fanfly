## TLDR

- Finished wire harness layout in the left wing
- Installed and tested pitot tube

## Wire harness

I went through each zip tie hole on the center stringer and tied down the harness.

I also installed some teflon wire protector at the wing root area as it seems the wire takes more stress/chafing in that area.

I also cut a buch of edge protectors to install on the stringer itself, so the metal doesn't cut the wire over time.

## Pitot tube installation

This was the difficult part in the wing.

Firstly it's new. It involves many things I have never done before. Secondly the component is very expensive. I was scared any mistake will break it. So overall I think I took more time than most people, but in the end I think I got the job done.

### Pitot Mast

I ran into a problem on the first step - riveting the mast onto the wing.

Because I previously installed the long aileron tube first, the tube blocked access for rivet gun to pull the rivets. So I drilled a large hole on the wing jig root end and pulled out the aileron tube by about 15 inches, then the mast was able to rivet to the spar no problem.

### Screw issue on the pitot tube

The pitot tube required 4 6-32 machine screws. But for some reason one of the holes simple does not take the screw. I switched many screws but just could not get the screww to fully go in.

At one point I used too much force, and twisted off the screw head. I was really surprised how little force I needed to do that. So any way, the screw was stuck in the hole, and has about 1 mm protruding, which was too short to use a plier to screw it out, and too long that it blocks the entire pitot tube from sliding out.

I had to undrill a few solid rivets from the mast assmebly, then was able to get the entire pitot tube out and remove the screw carefully using a thin plier.

I have an #6-32 3/16 screw on order. They are supposed to be shorter than the ones I'm usnig now. 3/16 is still within the acceptable range specified by Garmin, And hpefully they will be short enough to fully go in.

### Control box mounting

The next big job was to mount the Garmin GAP26 control box near the pitot tube.

I know some folks just drill 4 holes on the inspection plate and mount it there. I wasn't thrilled about the idea of having expensive parts and wire attached to an inspection plate. So I decideded to mount it to the rib right next to the pitot tube.

First I cut a scrape piece of aluminum and match drilled 4mm holes using the controller box as a template.

Then I transfered the holes from the aluminum template to the rib. I enlarged the holes to fit 4 M4 rivnuts (with loctite 277).

Finally I mounted the controller to the rib using hex screws.

### Air hoses

The next step is straightforward. I ran 2 air tubes through the wing to reach the pitot tube.

I chose the _GREEN_ tube as pitot, and the _RED_ as AOA.

### Bending the pitot tubes

The 2 aluminum tubes came with GAP26 was super long, and stright goes up. I needed to both cut them and bend them so they can smoothly connect to the plastic tubes, and they have to be longer than 8 inches.

I tried to bend them with hand while attached to the wing. I was able to do that but all the parts around it were shaking as I moved things around. I decided to just take the part off the wing to bend it, then insert back.

While I was removing/inserting the tubes, I noticed the rivets inside of the mast were rubbing the tubes, so I put some temperary silicon tape for protection. They were removed at the end.

After some finessing, the tubes were finally connected!

### Wiring

After the tubes, I moved on to connecting the wires.

First I created a "bridge" between the aluminum tube and the wire so they don't rub against each other.

While I was there, I created a whole bunch of bridgets to add some rigidity for the air tubes too.

Then I connected the wires between the pitot tube and the controller box.

- Red -> White
- Black -> White banded
- Thin wires with connector -> thin wires with connector

I then bundled the wires in a small loop, and attached it to the rib using an adel clamp.

_Adel clamp installed_

It was an interesting experience because I have never used adel clamp before.

Now that the pitot tube side work is done, I removed the temperary silicon tape.

_Silicon tape removed_

Then I connected the control box wires to my wing harness wires using heatshrink crimpers.

- Red -> Pitot power
- Black -> Pitot ground
- Blue -> Pitot feedback

I wrapped the wire into a loop and anchored it on the rib as well.
