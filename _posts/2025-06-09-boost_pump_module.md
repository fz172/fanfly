# TLDR

- Installed the boost pump control module
- Connected cabin heater duct on the copilot side
- Installed upholstery on the center channel copilot side

I planned to just install the boost pump control module but ended up doing much more.

# Details

The boost pump comes with several electronic parts. Today I installed the control module box.

## Controller Positioning

The recommended position for the control module is in the center channel below the avionics rack.

I first put the channel skin on the airplane, then placed the control module to where it's supposed to go, and marked its position.

Then I took everything down, match drilled 4 holes for AN3 bolts. They are used to secure the control box to the channel skin.

## Cabin heater duct hole 

I thought now is a good time to install the cabin heater vents and ducts for the copilot side. Because once the skin in installed it's less accessible. So I started to modify the skin and install the vent.

The vent I am using has 2-inch diameter. I used a hole cutter from Amazon to make the hole. For some reason, the hole cutter says the diameter is 2 inches but the hole it cut is far larger than 2 inch. So of course the 2 inch vent that came from the Sling kit wouldn't fit. I had to cut a piece of spare aluminum and make a smaller hole, then attach the smaller hole onto the skin over the larger hole.

_The initial hole is too large, made a smaller hole to patch over it_

## Upholstery

This is again an unexpected piece of work.

I realized that if I put on the vent without upholstery, I would have a hard time getting ht leather upholstery on the skin. So I had to glue on the upholstery now.

After the upholstery, I could finally put the hot air vent.

## Connecting the air duct

Once the prep work was all done, I clecoed that section of skin back onto the airplane for final positioning. 

Then I eyeballed the air duct and cut off extra length, and used zebra clamp to secure it onto the air vent.
