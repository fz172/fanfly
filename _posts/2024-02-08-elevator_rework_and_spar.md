- Riveted all ribs on elevator (`EL-ASS-001-C-F-0` sheet 11)

### Detail

### Replacing rib1

Following the theme of rework, I finally replaced the right rib1 on the elevator.

It needed to be replaced because I drilled a _very_ elongated hole when trying to drill out a rivet a couple of weeks ago. Here is a picture for illustration.

With the new part in hand, I went ahead and drilled out the old piece. In order to remove this piece, I needed drill out 8x4.8mm rivets, and 4x4.0mm rivets.

I've removed many 4.0mm before so nbd, THE 4.8mm ones made me a little nervous because of their position. They were right at the center of the main spar holding the 2 halves together, I really didn't want to mess this up. Fortunately, I did not make any of the holes worse. The primer got severely scratched, but that's easy fix.

The old rib1 is out!

### Completing spar assembly

With the old rib1 out of the way, I was able to proceed and complete the spar assembly.

I laid out all pieces at roughly where they would go just to get an idea.

The next step is to cleco things together.

Interestingly, on the spar extension - the KAI says to use 3.2mm rivet but the pre-drilled holes are 4.0mm size. So I went ahead with 4.0mm rivet following my common sense. I sent a question to the Sling builder group to see if others have seen this issue in their builds.

After clecoing and reaming a few holes, I riveted everything together.
