## TLDR

- Continued routeing the wiring harness
- Put GTR 205xR on the radio rack

## Detail

## Wiring harness

Continuing yesterday's work, I got both of the wing connectors routed in place.

To put the wing connectors through the main spar, I removed the pins from both connectors. As I removed each pin, I put a temporary label on them to mark the pin number, and used the wiring diagram provided by Midwest Panel Builders as a cross-check reference.

I was worried the depin tool might not able to push out all the pins and get stuck somewhere (this happened when I depined the control stick wires), but everything went fine.

### GTR 205xR

Next I did was installing the GTR205xR to the radio rack. I want to do this so I can get an accurate placement of the coax cables, then I will be able to crimp the other end and install the GPS on the back.

It took me a few minutes to figure out how to secure the radio on the rack. The locking mechanism is actually pretty smart. It uses a hex wrench to rotate a locking notch thing, which locks the whole unit in place. The installation manual has more details.

Another thing is that the connector on the radio is not the standard BNC type. I don't know what it's called, but it has a flare on the plug. I struggled to figure out how to connect this to the BNC connectors that came with my harness. Then I realized they provided adapters, derp..
