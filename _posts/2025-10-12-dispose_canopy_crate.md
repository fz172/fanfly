## TLDR

- Took apart the canopy crate

## Details

I'm done with the canopy windows, and moved the remaining parts to a smaller box.

With that, the canopy crate is officially empty!

I need the space to put the engine crate. So I spent some time to disemble the crate and throw it out in parts.

The process was pretty much just muscle work, with some help of a band saw. 45 minutes later, the crate is gone :-)
