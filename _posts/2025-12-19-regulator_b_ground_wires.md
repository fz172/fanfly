## TLDR

- Grounded Regulator B to Airframe
- Clean up master relay wires
- Researched on throttle cable connection

## Details

### Regulator B Grounding

The Rotax instruction says the Regulator B should be grounded to the airframe through the grounding plate.

I made a #12 grounding wire with ring terminals on both ends. Attaching the wire on the regulator end was trivial. Unfortunately I was out of black wires, so I used the red wire but printed a label and attached to the wire.

But to attach it on the airframe, I needed to loosen up the nut on the grounding lug on the firewall, which was just a AN4 bolt. I needed to access both sides of the firewall to loosen the bolt, and re-tighten it. Needless to say, that was painful..

#### Future work

I have another lug in the same predicament. On the other side of the firewall I have the battery's negative lug connected to an AN4 bolt for grounding. When I install the engine, I think there will be 1 more cable between the engine and the airframe ground. So I bought a few fully threaded brass bolts and nuts. The plan is to use a nut just to secure the bolts, and another nut to hold down the lugs. In the future when I need to make adjustments to the lugs, I won't need to crawl under the firewall.

### Cleaning Up Master Relay

I also re-did the wires on the master relay and attached rubber boot for extra protection.

### Throttle Cable Research

I'm still confused about what part I'm missing to connect the throttle cable to the throttle quadrant.

While the SB24 kit is on order, I did my own research. I am missing a rod end or clevis end. I took some measurements on the throttle cable and the throttle quadrant, so missing part would look like this.

So I went to McMaster and ordered a #10-32 female threaded rod end with 1/4 opening. The shank width is 5/16", which is larger than the Sling provided bushing. But I think I might not need the bushing at all, since it has its own bearing, and I can just connect it through an AN4 directly. We will see.
