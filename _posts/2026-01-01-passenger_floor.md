## TLDR

- Fully riveted passenger floor

## Details

With brake bleeding complete, I've verified the brake lines were holding pressure and no leaks. I was finally able to close the two passenger floor skin.

This one took surprisingly long, partially because I haven't done riveting for a while and it took me some time to clean the area, find the tools, and climbing in and out of the cockpit didn't help either.

This job isn't the hardest, nor is it the most fun one. However it felt like a huge milestone for some reason. Maybe it's because brake bleeding is finally done, or that the passenger floor is more complete. I am not sure, but really happy to see the rear row to have actual floor skins!
