## TLDR

- Moved the engine to the hangar

## Details

I'm close to install the engine. So today I moved the engine to the hangar.

The move was really uneventful. Most of the time is spent on prepping. In total I spent about 2 hours of getting the truck, loading the engine, tying everything down. Then 1 hour of driving, 10 minutes of unloading and 1 hour of returning truck.

I did the move with a 10 ft U-Haul truck and a pallet jack from Amazon. I chose the jack that can raise at least 30", because I needed the jack to clear the height of the u-haul truck's loading door.
