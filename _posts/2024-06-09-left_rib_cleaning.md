## Tasks completed

- Cleaned right wing top root skin
- Cleaned all left ribs that requires assembly

## Details

My fingers are still raw from riveting the bottom skin, so I did not do anything heavy weight today.

### Ribs

My friend Daniel is coming over in a few days to help me build. I think building a few ribs will be fun. So I sepnt today to debur and clean all left ribs. It's super tedious but I finally got it done.

At the end of day I cleaned and deburred left rib 1, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and also finished cleanning trailing rib 304 (the replacement from damaged part a few days ago). I put all parts back to the baggie they came with to keep them from garage dust. When we are ready to build I will take them out again.

_All parts cleaned and put in bags_

### Top root wing skin

This part was easy. I spent total 20 minutes tops to peel off the plastic, debur, clean. When the plastic is easy to peel on a large piece like this, it's such a great feeling :)
