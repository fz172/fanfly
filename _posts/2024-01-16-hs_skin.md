Today I fully removed the plastic wrapping from both horizontal skin. Since it was already in the evening, I was too lazy to
do the clean/rinse dance. I think I will leave it to tomorrow maybe.

I adjusted my work table to get ready for dimpling the skin. The skin was large and already bent to fit the spar. The bend made it very difficult to 
feed into DRDT-2. I tried to dimple one hole that's close to the edge. It can be done but it was very awkward because I had to hold a very large piece and work the tool at the same time. I could just lay the skin on the table, but that will involve unbending the skin. I am not sure if that's ok. I will do some research..
