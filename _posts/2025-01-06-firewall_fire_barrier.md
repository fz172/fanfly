# TLDR

- Applied some fire proof sealant to firewall
- Added fire barrier foam to the firewall
- Installed Naviflow bulkhead fittings

# Detail

## Fire barrier

I bought some 3M firemaster 2000+ sealant to apply along the perimeters of the cawling strip, as there is a gap that can let air go through between the firewall forward and cockpit. I don't know if this is an important thing, but I decided to seal it anyway.

The foam material that came with Sling is Teknofibra 6mm self-adhesive heat barrier.

I cut it to fit the shape of the firewall, and attached it. I am a little worried about the attachment as it covered a lot of holes on the firewall. I am not sure what they are. So I suppose I might have to remove some part of the heat shield later if needed.

## Naviflow

Another thing that I did was installing the rivnuts and bulkhead AN6 fittings for the [Naviflow](https://aerospaceinno.com/product/naviflow-fuel-manifold-for-rotax-is/) unit.

It came with the proper drill templates and the 3d printed jig to help align th holes. I drilled the holes on the firewall and installed the 2 AN6 fittings and 3 rivnuts. The installation itself is fine, but I was surprised how difficult it is to drill holes on the firewall. The steel material is significantly harder to work with than the aluminum. And deburring took me a while due to the awkward positioning.
