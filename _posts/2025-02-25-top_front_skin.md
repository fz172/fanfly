# TLDR

- Prepared top front skin installation

# Detail

In order to know precisely where the avionics rack will position, I needed to have the top front skin in place.

I haven't finished the work like cabin heater or throttle cable yet, so it's not the time to fully close the top skin. So I spent the last fewn nights to prepare everything, just minus the actual riveting part.

## Test fitting

The top front skin I received goes into the side skin, not covering it. That makes things easier to align. It didn't take me too long on this part.

Once I set the skin in place, the rear half is fine, but the front half couldn't sit fully inside the side skin. So I used a pencile to draw how much I needed to cut. Then I took it off and removed some skin material using dremel cutoff wheel.

It's really messy. Dust everywhere.
