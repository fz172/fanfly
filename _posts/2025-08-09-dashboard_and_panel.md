## TLDR

- Sealed the sides of the top front skin
- Installed dashboard and instrument panel (partially)
- Started to prep fuel selector

## Detail

### Top front skin

The sides of the top front skin got a row of skia 295 for added water proofing.

I ran a blue painters tape along the edge of the aluminum side skin, then a 1/4" vinyl tape above, then another line of painters tape. Then I removed the middle vinyl tape to leave a perfectly distanced line for putting the Sika 295 in.

### Fuel selector hole cutout

Since I'm using the fuel boost pump system from MWPB, I needed to slightly mod the fuel selector mounting position by enlarging the mounting hole.

The kit comes with the jig to set the hole size. I drilled 4 holes and cleco-ed the jig piece on the leather where fule selector would go, then used a cutoff disc to cut away most of the material. Lastly I used a dremel sanding bit to remove all the extra material so the hole cutout was exactly the size I needed.

_As you can see there are a lot of roughly edges on the hole. They will be cut away with a craft knife_

### Dashboard & instrument panel

#### Dasboard

Then I put the dashboard on top of the front skin. The fitting was a little difficult as a single person job, but wasn't too bad.

One tricky part was connecting the air vent when the dashboard was going in. The. space wasn't really big. Fortunately I'm pretty skinny, I wiggled my hand quite a bit and finaly secured the air vents using some zebra clamps.

#### Instrument panel

After the dashboard was in place, I proceeded to connect wires. So far I stil have a few loose wires: airmaster controller, the fuel pump power, heater related stuff.

I conducted a power on test after the wires were connected. Unfortunately the screen did not turn on. I fell into panic and started to shoot emails to MWPB for help. This process went back and forth for 3+ hours. And at last I realized I simply forgot to turn on avionics switch...
