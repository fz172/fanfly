## TLDR

- Installed fuel boost pump to both wings

## Detail

I finally got to add the fuel boost pump upgrade to the wings. The job is spread out over multiple weeks due to life and other work. This log entry summarizes the tasks I did over the entire period.

This boost pump system is made by Aerospace Innovation, a company ran by Midwest Panels and Midwest Sports.

I followed their [video instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pdvVVJbmzQ&list=PLct-i1ThgHWcq5qc3sLU2xv5L7V3TT0Ud) step by step.

_Before starting, here are the raw ingredients_

### clam shell plates

A few 3d printed parts and a few nutserts need to be placed on the clamshell plates, then attached to the wing root.

However, when I put the plates on the wing, the plate labeled as "inner" is facing outwards, and the "outer" plate is facing inwards. This happens to both the wings. So I'm not sure what's wrong. It could be as simple of they mis-labeled the parts, or I completely put together the parts in the wrong way. Although the plates are already pre-countersunk, and holes pre-drilled. So it's really not possible to mess up the fitting, at least I don't think so.

### Fuel pump fittings

Then I installed the fittings onto the fuel pumps.

Test fitted the fuel pump on the clam shell plate.

### Final install and tightening everything up

After testing fitting the fuel pump with the braided lines, I added the 1-1/4" adel clamp and tightened the bolts to make the entire assembly secure in place on both wings.

### Torquing AN fittings

I've never worked with AN fittings before so I spent a lot time researching how to torque them properly.

My EAA adviser suggested to use the "flat" method. Basically I first hand-tighten the an fittings, then turn the nut a quarter turn. That's it.

I did this to all the AN fittings on the pump, then marked them with torque seal.

### Worries on leak

One thing that makes me worried is the surface of the flare tube connecting to the fuel pump lines. The flaring surface is quite uneven and I don't know if there will be any leak. I've never built AN fuel lines before so I don't know what it should look like. I have sent a question to Aerospace Info (the company that makes them). And I think we will find out when I do fuel testing.
