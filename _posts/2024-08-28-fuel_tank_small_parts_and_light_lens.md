## TLDR

- Fuel sender and a few smal parts for left tank
- Tried to fit left landing light lens

## Details

### Fuel tank parts

I wanted to front load some work before sealing the left tank.

#### Fuel level sender

I chose to first finish the fuel level sender. I took apart the fuel level sender from its original assembly. Then installed it to the Sling sender cover. I needed to slightly enlarge a few holes to make the o-ring fit. But overall it's not too bad.

I took some extra time to measure the ohm level to make sure I installed it at the correct orientation, since the instruction showed only the right sender. So I needed to mirror it to keep the ohm reading correct.

I smeared a ton of pro-seal on the cover. Then I put it aside to cure.

#### AN fittings

There is an AN4 fitting on the fuel overflow port, and an AN6 for the fuel inlet. I tried to fit them on the rib with washers. I didn't tighten them yet. I want to hold off pro-sealing until I match drill everything. Once all the match drilling shavings are cleaned up I will pro-seal them both.

Cover and doubler\_

This is the strange part. I started by clecoing the lens and doubler together. It's a good fit.

However, when I try to fit the lens to the wing skin it does **_not_** fit at all.

I can barely cleco the top and bottom row of holes to the skin, but the sides are completely out of whack. The holes are not even close to match.

_Sides do not match_

From the picture above, the holes on the lens and the skin are completely out of alignment. No amount of countersinking or match drilling will help... I think Sling sent me wrong parts or something. I will need to drill new holes and probably close the old ones with some JB weld.

Since this will be in a tight space, I can imagine this will be a long job.
