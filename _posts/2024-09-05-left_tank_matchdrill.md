## TLDR

- Installed the last few rows of rivet on the bottom side of the wing walk
- Match drilled the left tank

## Details

### Wing walk rivets

I previously left a few rows of rivets on the bottom side of the wing walk due to access issues.

With the wing set on the table, it's more accessible so I spent 30 minutes or so to install those. The last row close to the trailing edge needed to be shortened, so it took a little more time.

### Left tank match drill

I match drilled every holes on the left tank in preparation of sealant.

The entire process is mindless and tedious. It was really easy to miss a hole. My system is to draw a line direclty on top of the hole with a marker after match drilling. Then I double check each hole has been marked.

_Marked holes are match drilled_

One step closer to sealing the tank!
