# TLDR

- Installed the rudder pedals

# Details

First step was easy. I cleaned the parts and installed the base plates that holds the rudder pedals.

Then I installed the two sets of rudder pedal without stopper to test the rotation and make sure there is no bindings.

There was a slight binding. I had to grind off the bushing holders slightly. It was more free after that but the pedals would not fall "by gravity" as other builders described.

I didn't want to shave off too much material from the base plate, so I just went ahead and installed the rudder foot step hoping things will get better. It did! Once the rudder foot rest was added, the whole tube got more weight and I guess less balanced. Now it does fall "by gravity".

So I am pretty happen about this part. I have the plates and tubes all cleco-ed together. Holding off the rivets for now just in case adding side skin will change anything.

I also fitted the control stopper on the pedal. It did require a significant amount of grinding to provide the clearance needed by the instruction manual.
