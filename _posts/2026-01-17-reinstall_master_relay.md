## TLDR

- Installed the new master relay

## Details

Received the new master relay from aircraft spruce yesterday. I tested the resistance between the two small terminals: 14 ohms. This is the normal range based on the datasheet.

I attached the new relay on the firewall with two new 1/4-20 bolts, and torqued to 55 in-lbs.

After connecting the battery cables back, I tested the circuit by turning on the master key. The dashboard lit up again. Phew!
