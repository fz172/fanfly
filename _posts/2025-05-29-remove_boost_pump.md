# TLDR

- Removed the boost pumps from both sides

# Details

Well I guess I spoke too soon last week. The saga on boost pumps are not done yet.

Earlier this week Aerospace Innovations (the manufacture of the boost pump mod) sent out an email warning a check valve issue, and they suggested that I should 
remove the boost pumps and sent them back for repair.

So I spent an hour or so taking them off the wings and packaged them up for shipping.
