## TLDR

- Installed a trim cover piece on rear fuselage

## Detail

So another thing I did today was to install a leather strip on the rear fuselage ceiling to cover all the rivet and glue at the rear/center fuselage connection.

I am not sure what to call this piece. The part name is rear fuselage jig. It's clearly not a jig. So I am calling it the trim cover.

It comes as a long leather strip with pre-marked drilling points. I followed the drilling points to create holes across the backing aluminum and the leather.

Then I put it on the airplane and center it on the rear fuselage ceiling. As the piece was centered, I drilled matching holes into the canopy.

Lastly, cleaned up the debris and riveted it in place. The rear section looks much nicer now!
