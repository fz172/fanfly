## Intro

First a little about me. Hi, I am Fan. I am a software engineer living in the bay area. I enjoy flying and currently hold PPL and IFR rating. I learned flying around 2010 and I have been buzzing around ever since.

After a long time of pondering, I recently made deposit to a tail kit
of [Sling Tsi](https://www.airplanefactory.com/aircraft/sling-tsi/)!

Since it will take a long time for the kit to arrive, I thought this is the time for me to get ready. 

I've been stalking other people's youtube and blogs for a while to learn how they progress through the journey. IMO it comes down at least a few big components: workshop preparation, sheet metal work, eletronics, powerplant, painting.  I've done some woodwork and built a few things in my garage in the past, but I don't really have a much experience working with any of these. So next few months I plan to learn as much as I can in these areas.

## Setting up blog

I am sure things will get messy at some point, I am trying to stay organized while I still have the luxury of time :) So today I spent a few hours to set up this blog to track future work.

I chose github pages and Jekyll as the infastructure to run my blog. This is because they are free, and I like the idea of checking in blogs posts as code. Later if I need to revise anything, github will maintain a nice check-in history that I can refer back to.

Jekyll is a popular static site generation engine, and many people use it for blogging. I've never used it before, so I spent some time to go through some crash course.

Here are some notes for future me..

* Installing Jekyll: [official doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

* Short youtube video to get started: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q)

* Rebuilding and serving locally: `bundle exec jekyll s`

## Adding time tracking

Tracking hours spent on task is important, so I poked around the theme I'm using and added support to track time spent on each task.

It displays below the blog title like so.
