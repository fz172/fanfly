### Window Painting

Continued from last week, and painted all remaining windows with my wife Ye. 2 layers of Krylon satin black spray paint. It came out really nice on all the windows. I'm really liking the final result. And more importantly, it provides an extra layer of protection on UV against the Sika glue/primers holding the windows together.

It was really time consuming. Same as last week, 90% masking and prepping, 10% painting.

### Fuel Pressure Sensor

I also started to work on the differential fuel sensor. Its part number is `UMA N1EU70D` which is a 70 PSI differential sensor.

One end goes into the fuel line, and the other goes into an air hose. Both ends are 1/8 NPT.

I followed my usual steps for 1/8 NPT. I applied a bit of NPT sealant, and screwed on the air hose side NPT to finger tight then started to turn it 1.5 turns per NPT fitting's common practice.

This is where it went sideways. Right at about 1 and a quarter turn, the sensor broke loose. By that I mean the top half of the sensor started to turn with my wrench turning the NPT while the lower half remained still. This was obviously not good, and sadly I had to buy a new one.
