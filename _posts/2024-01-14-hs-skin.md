Today I spent some time to rivet the HS spar assembly together, happily marked `HS-ASS-001-C-F-0` sheet 5 complete.

## Corner rivets

Several rivets were very close to the edge of the spar, and my Milwaukee rivet gun was unable to reach the rivet without damaging
the spar. This [corner rivet tool](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/all/products/close-quarter-rivet-pulling-wedge) was super helpful. It turns the rivet stem by a few degrees, opening
a just big enough gap for the gun to reach. I used this tool on a few 3.2 mm rivets.

A few 4mm rivets was also close to edge, but the corner tool was
only designed to fit 3.2 mm rivets, so I couldn't use it on the 4mm
rivets. I might consider drilling the hole larger next time. For today's work, I just switched to a hand riveter and finished those corner rivets.


Oh and my wife Ye officially pulled her first rivet on 'HS-RIB-004-X-F-0' on the rigth side and left her autograph!  

After all the riveting, I measured alignment using laser edge again. They still align which is good.

## Skin prep

To be honest I was dreading to prepare the HS skin. The protective plastic was just so awful to peel off. I spent maybe half an hour to one hour this afternoon to pull off he plastic on one sheet of skin. My fingers went numb after I was done with just one side. And
I haven't even cleaned it yet.  I will do that tomorrow maybe. Peeling off the plastic is now officially my least favorite thing.
