In case it might be useful to anyone, I want to share my experience with [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com).

As I make progress in my build my browser bookmark grows quickly. I've been putting my build notes (ac43.13 pdf, build blogs, youtube videos etc) into NotebookLM. I then ask questions to NotebookLM and it specifically grounds its answer to only the document I put in. So to me it's an easy way to go through my notes, distill answers from multiple sources, find things in 43.13 etc. Always need to double check the answer though, it's AI and it can hallucinate.
