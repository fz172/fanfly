### TLDR

- Riveted the left flap (except leading row of rivets)

### Details

Yesterday I already prepared the ribs and skin for the left flap, so today's work was mostly straightforward.

I first clecoed the parts together, first bottom side then top side.

I then took a quick look at the bend on both edges, and there was no bend. This is the same situate as the right flap/aileron. On the right, I also ran into slight bend on the aileron and no bend on the flap. At least they are symmetrical. Hmm.

Then I started to insert 3.2mm rivets. No match drilling needed. A few holes needed to a bit more force to push, but easy enough.

After that, I shot all the rivets.

The whole process was very smooth and pleasant :->

## EAA tech counseling

I reached out to Jason, a member of my local EAA chapter and also a technical counselor to look over my work. We agreed to a date later this month so I can show him my work.

With this scheduled it changed my work plan a little. I was originally hoping to close the left wing skin soon. But now I want to keep it open for Jason to look at.

So I think I will switch back to the right wing - since the top skin is already closed. I will work on getting the right aileron/flap fitted, change the leading edge, and getting the fuel tank started if I have time.

## Issue with countersink skin

I am not sure I mentioned this in my previous blog or not. But I ran into a significant misalignment on the main spar countersink reinforcement plate.

_main spar countersink reinforcement plate misalignment_

Since this plate's main purpose is to provide extra thickness and surface area to the countersink rivets, I didn't like the idea of match drilling. Besides, at this level of misalignment, the match drilling will for sure enlarge the holes too much if I measure using AC43-13's standard.

I asked Sling technical if it's ok to cut the plate in half and align them individually, and they said **_Yes_**. So that's great news as in I don't need to manufacture a separate plate.

I will cut it when I get to the riveting part with the plate and leading edge skin.
