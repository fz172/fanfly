## TLDR

- Painted the trim of one rear window

## Details

After gluing the windows on canopy, a lot of builders paint the window trim band to cover the Sika glue. The theory is that the paint will protect the glue from direct UV. I think that makes sense. And since I drilled holes to install door handles, it gave me one more reason to have something cover the window edge.

So today I decided to do a trail run with one of the windows.

The material I used is just Krylon Fusion all in one satin black paint. I used some fine line tape, blue painters tape and masking plastic film to fully cover the inside and outside of the window, and only left the narrow band where the glue was applied. This process probably took 80% of the entire time.

After the masking is done, it's painting time! To me, that's the fun part. I have never used this type of paint but the technique is the same as applying primers. I did the "wet on dry" approach: first a very thin layer, then wait for it to dry, then another layer. I applied 3 layers in total.

The end result was pretty good.
