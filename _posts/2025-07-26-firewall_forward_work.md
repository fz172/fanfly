# TLDR

- Installed battery bracket
- Install the gascalator and naviflow base plate

# Detail

## Oil tank bracket

Super easy to install. Clecoed the bracket on the firewall and shot 10x 4.0mm rivets.

## Battery bracket

The left and bottom side of the battery bracket went on easily.

But the right side has a strengthener. There was not enough space for the rivet gun. So I had to rivet the strengthener and teh bracket. from the back of the firewall. And in order to to do that, I had to first temporarily remove the cabin heater. It was a bit of a mess, but I got it done eventually.

## Naviflow base plate

The layout of the naviflow baseplate is fairly self-explanatory. I double checked the instruction with their youtube video, and installed the gascalator on the base plate with 3 M5 screws. Then I installed the assembled unit to the firewall using another 3 M5 screws.
