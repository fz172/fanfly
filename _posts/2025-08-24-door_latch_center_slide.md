## TLDR

- Made two sliding tubes for the door latch mechanism

## Detail

On the canopy build instruction `CA-ASS-101-C-F`, there is a plastic cable tie type thing going onto the center of the door latch torque tube.

The consensus from the builder forum is that this plastic thing isn't strong enough for the torque tube. And on my airplane the tube is quite far away from the capony. So if I use the factory provided plastic part directly it will bow the tube significant, and increase the stress on this part even more.

So I followed what most people did on the forum and replaced the plastic part with a proper adel clamp, and used a short copper tube behind the adel clamp as a stand-off to keep the tube straight.

For each side, I needed 2 tubes - one sliding over the torque tube as a guide, and aonther shorter one as the stand-off. Amy gracefully agreed to help me on both! She cut 2 perfect piece of copper tubes and we installed them together as a team.

And we did this for both sides. It's super hot today in the hangar so we decided to just get out of there and enjoy some air-conditioning once we were done with this part.
