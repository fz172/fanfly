## TLDR

- Finished installing antenna plates
- Completed the luggage extension carpeting

## Detail

### Antenna plates

Previously I finished installing all antenna plates except two: the top plate for comm1, and one on top of luggage compartment for GPS2 (GA-56). The GA-56 had issues with nut plates and I ran out of rivets ([reference]({% post_url 2025-02-08-antenna_plates %})). My order arrived so I installed the two plates quickly.

### Carpeting

My intention is to make the center console as complete as possible before moving everything to the airport hangar. Since I have never worked with carpeting before, I started with the luggage area. If I make any mistake there, nobody will discover :)

The upholstery kit did not have much instructions. The only thing I could find is a few pages on the fuselage KAI. It's like a jigsaw puzzle. I spent most of the evening guessing which piece should go where. At the end I decided to start with the luggage extension bottom floor.

Someone on the builder group recommended Barge Cement for glue, so that's what I used.

I smeared the glue both on the floor and the carpet, and used a roller thing to press the carpet down firmly. I will wait for a couple of days to see how they attach to each other. I don't expect to see any problem though.

This process went slower than I thought. As I get more familiar with how this works I am hoping to speed up.
