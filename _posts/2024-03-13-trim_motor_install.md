### Details

Today I received the new cotter pins from aircraft spruce, so I spent a few minutes to install the trim motor.

I also filled and sanded all rivets on the tail in the last few days. Everything is pretty much done in the empennage section, I cut the crate box apart and cleaned up my garage to make space for the next stage of my build :-)
