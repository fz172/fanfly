# TLDR

- Added fuel boost pump to both wings

# Detail

I finally got to add the fuel boost pump upgrade to the wings.

This system is made by Aerospace Innovation, a company ran by Midwest Panels and Midwest Sports.

I pretty much followed their [video instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pdvVVJbmzQ&list=PLct-i1ThgHWcq5qc3sLU2xv5L7V3TT0Ud) step by step.

## clam shell plates

A few 3d printed parts and a few nutserts need to be placed on the clamshell plates, then attached to the wing root.

However, when I put the plates on the wing, the plate labeled as "inner" is facing outwards, and the "outer" plate is facing inwards. This happens to both the wings. So I'm not sure what's wrong. It could be as simple of they mis-labeled the parts, or I completely put together the parts in the wrong way. Although the plates are already pre-countersunk, and holes pre-drilled. So it's really not possible to mess up the fitting, at least I don't think so.

## Fuel pump fittings

Then I installed the fittings onto the fuel pumps.

Test fitted the fuel pump on the clam shell plate.
