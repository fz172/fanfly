# TLDR

- Installed the ELT

# Detail

I got my ELT and the antenna from Midwest Panel Builders a couple of weeks ago. I decided to install it - following what most builders have done - under the rear passenger seat on the right side.

The ELT is Artex 345. It comes with a mounting tray and just needs four rivets to install.

I installed the trey on one of the ribs near the rear passenger seat. The rib already have 2 holes perfectly lined with the mounting tray. I drilled two more holes and inserted 4x4.8mm rivets and got the job done.

I also smeared some left-over sikaflex 221 between the rib and mounting trey to reduce vibration.
