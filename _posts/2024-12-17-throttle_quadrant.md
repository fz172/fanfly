# TLDR

- Built the throttle quadrant

# Details

I'm back from a 3 week business trip and wanted to resume the work from something easy. So I picked throttle quadrant as my next project.

I was thinking this should be a 2 hour project, and it turned into 4.5 hours. I am not familiar with the NPT fittings and the brake lines but still not difficult overall.

## Nuts and bolts

Putting the rivets, rivnuts, bolts together is easy. I just followed Evan's video and the KAI as step by step. Then I torqued everything except the throttle cable bolt.

I don't think I have the cable in the fuselage kit. Maybe it's in the finishing kit. Not sure.

And I've previously painted the top panel white. It looks pretty nice.

## Throttle Handle

One complexity is the throttle handle. It has a M4 bolt go through and I need to obviously tighten it. However the hole for the M4 nuts are deep and none of my tools can reach into the hole.

I am currently leaving it aside. Will need to modify my socket to be thinner to torque the bolt here.

## Brake lines

The brake handle is connected to a cylinder, which has 4 NPT fittings that connect to brake lines.

The line is fairly rigid. I have not worked with NPT fittings before so definitely a little nervous.

For now, I needed to connect 2 fittings together. I measured the length needed, and cut the brake line to fit. I then used a heat gun to soften the line, and connected to the fitting's coupling and tightened them.

I hope it doesn't leak. I tied a balloon on the line and used Snoop to test the fittings. This is the same stuff I used to test fuel tank a few months ago.

_Underside of the quadrant_

For now, this is all I have done for the throttle quadrant. Remaining work: connect the throttle line, connect the rest of brake line.
