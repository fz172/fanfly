# TLDR

- Test fitted the dashboard and panel on airplane
- A bunch of wiring clean up
- Test routed cabin heater tension cable


# Details


## Test fit
I put the dashboard and panel assembly on the airplane. This is the first time they go onto the airplane together :)

With the panel on the airplane, I was able to check the wiring/connections are at their proper location and nothing is too short/too long. 

## Cabin heater tension cable

It also allowed me to test route the cabin heater tension cable. I did not take any picture, but I routed the cable behind the panel, trough pilot side rack, go along with the naca duct, then reach the cabin heater. With this routing I don't think I need to cut any length off the heater cable.

Since this cable connects both the cabin (already on the airplane), and the panel (need to be removed from airplane soon), I am thinking I will connect the cable when the panel is on the airplane, secure the routing, then remove the knob from the panel. Then I will just re-install the knob next time I do the final fitting of the panel.

Planning done, will do it tomorrow.

## Cleaning up wires

Whiling fitting the panel, I noticed several wires on the rack were pretty messy. I took off the panel and spent some time tidying them up using cable ties.

## Cabin heater duct

So I also worked on the pilot side cabin heater vent.

My original plan was to mirror the copilot side location. But the space is so confined, it doesn't fit two 2-inch aluminum ducts side by side. So I had to offset the pilot side to the front by a few inches.

I ended up choosing the location directly above the rudder peddle. This time I didn't punt 2-inch hole. I punched a 1.5 inch hole and used a dremel sanding bit to just enlarge it a tiny bit. This worked well, as I was able to snug fit a factory vent.

I then cut the duct to length and connected it to the vent behind the skin.

While I was on the subject of cabin heater duct, I also cut two small chunks for the dashboard vents.

_The other end will connect to the naca duct_

## Upholstery

Once I was done with the ducting work, I started on some upholstery work. The first few skins that need upholstery are the front dash side skin and the front-most ones on the center channel. This is because once the dashboard is installed it will be a lot harder to access the space for upholstery installation.

### Center channel skin

For center channel, not too bad. I already finished installing the copilot side when installing the copilot cabin heater duct the other day. So I just glued on the leather to the pilot side. I also used soldering iron to burn through the rivnut holes.

### Side skin

Side skin's upholstery is a large piece. I had a feeling it wouldn't fit, and turns out it indeed didn't fit my side skin. It was not too off though. I cut the rear end short by an inch or so, and widened the gap that lets seat channel go through a little. Then the whole upholstery fitted the skin OK.

For a while I didn't know how to attach it to the skin, as there was no holes on the skin. Then I noticed on the back of the upholstery they marked 8 spots. I think I am supposed to drill holes and attach the upholstery with rivnuts. 

I will do this tomorrow.

### Luggage compartment

This part was not necessary for the instrument panel building. I was just procrastinating on the side skin rivnuts, so I decided to find something easier to do. 

I finished glueing the remaining carpets in the luggage area. 5 puzzle pieces solved from the random carpet piles in my kit crate! Yay!
