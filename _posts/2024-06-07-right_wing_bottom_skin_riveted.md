## Tasks completed

* Riveted the right bottom skin (except 1 rivet)
* Prepped wing hardness


## Rigth bottom skin

Continuing the work I started earlier this week, I spent many hours to insert rivets and pulled all but one rivets on the bottom skin. 

Across the 300+ rivets, I ended up match drilling 2 or 3. The rest mostly aligned well. There are a few stubborn ones, and I was able to get them in using an icepick. The ones that needed icepicks were almost all from the center stringer.

### Rib 9

One rivet was unable to go in on the rear end of rib 9.  The rivet hits the rib as there is not enough clearance. I sent an email to Sling technical, hopefully I will have an answer soon. My guess is that I will need to file down the rib a little bit for the rivet to fit.

## Wing harness

I am almost ready to install the wing harness. I ordered some plastic grommet which should be here on Monday. I will replace the rubber grommet with the plastic ones as rubber will decay overtime.

I also put some braided cable sleeve on a section of the wing harness to provide an extra protection when it goes through the ribs. I haven't decided if I need cable sleeve on the entire cable. Maybe..

### AD3?

One interesting note: on right wing harness I found an extra set of connectors labeled AD3C22. I am not sure what those are. Sling build instruction only mentioned position lights and landing lights. I already have connection for them. Someone on facebook said this is the OAT connector. It makes a lot of sense.. I will confirm with MPB. I also need to find out where my OAT is.. I have not seen it in my kit.
