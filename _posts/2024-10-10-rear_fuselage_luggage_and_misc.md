# TLDR

- Installed luggage extension box to rear fuselage
- Installed static port
- Installed GMU11 mount

# Luggage box

Fitted the luggage box and the front plate on Rib 3 and Rib 4. Then riveted them together. Not difficult, but because the parts were bulky so it took a little bit of fiddling to get them in place.

Then I also installed the safety belt reinforcement plates on both sides.

# Static port

I decided to use Vans static port and put it on the rear fuselage. The location is roughly at the middle of the fuselage. I measured 3 rivets after rib 4, and 2 rivets up.

_Marking the location of static ports_

I drilled 6mm holes on each side, and installed the static ports. I also glued them using pro-seal from behind for extra safety.

_Vans static ports_

Since I moved the static port location, the hose I got from Midwest Panel Builder wasn't long enough. I ordered some more from stein air. Once it arrives I will install the hoses, which should be trivial.

# GMU 11 Mount

Another easy task I did was installing the GMU 11 mount. It's 8 rivnuts and 8 screws, very simple. The only special part is that the rivnuts are made from aluminum, and the screws are brass to avoid magnetic interference.

Interestingly, the screws I got were countersink screws. I don't understand why I need to countersink them. So I just bought a few regular brass screws and replaced them. Everything still works out.
