# TLDR

- Installed left tank back channel

# Details

## Front channel leak test

One thing I did this time was that I put in some watch in the tank before riveting the back channel, to make sure the front side didn't leak.

_Tape on top of water line_

I poured about 2 gallons of watch, and put a blue tap right on top to mark the water line.

Then I waited overnight to example I didn't have any watch on the floor and the water line didn't drop. Then I proceeded to work on the back channel.

## Back channel

This was a long evening - 4 hours of prosealing and riveting on the back channel.

The process isn't complex, I mixed proseal up, squeezed to the back channel and ribs, and then riveted them together.

There were a lot of rivets, and proseal sticks to everything and slow down the process signficantly. So the entire process took more than 4 hours to complete.

I was trying to focus and speed up in the process, so I didn't take too many pictures.

## Special notes on a few rivets

_The 3.2mm rivets on the side are super difficult to get to_

From this picture, there are 4 3.2mm rivets that needs to be riveted on the rib pointing upwards. the are located very close to the nutplate.

I made the wrong choice of installing the nutplate first, and just couldn't get to the holes to rivet them. So I had to drill out the plate that has the 2 nutplates, install the 3.2 rivets, then install the nutplate back. The process wiped off a lot proseal, so I hope I didn't create any leak in this process.
