## TLDR

- Installed brake lines on the throttle quadrant

## Details

I test fitted the brake lines loosely connected to the throttle quadrant and the throttle quadrant in the cockpit.

I had to turn one of the fittings on the master cylinder to make the brake line connect with no tension. And I also cut off a small chunk of the dashboard leather near the fuel selector to sit the throttle quadrant properly.

After that, everything went together nicely and I tightened the AN fittings between the brake lines and the master cylinder.
