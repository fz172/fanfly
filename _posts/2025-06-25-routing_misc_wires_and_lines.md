### Line routing

Didn't really plan to do this, but as I was prepping the center channel skin the lines and wires felt messy. I ended up spending a few hours to rout the fuel/brake lines from the front, routed the rear passenger air duct.

Not much to call out in specific, it was just tedious work on routing and zip tying along the way.

### Center channel skin

To better guide me with the line routing, I also temporarily installed the center channel skins.

To prepare the skin, it required the standard clean/debur sequence. It's been a while since I did this. I kinda missed peeling off plastic film from sheet aluminum. Anyways, I match cut the leather and carpet upholstery for the skin and glued them together. Took me 2-3 hours to get the cutting and gluing perfect. Then I enlarged each screw holes a little bigger to make installing rivnuts easier later. Inserting screws after upholstery is done is already very challenging to me.
