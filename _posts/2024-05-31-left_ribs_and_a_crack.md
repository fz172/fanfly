## TLDR

- Continued to clean up left ribs

## Cleaning details

I continued my journey of peeling plastics and cleaning up parts. I went through maybe a dozen of ribs from the left wing (all center ribs that don't have a hinge, all trailing ribs, all leading ribs).

Same as yesterday, I only cleaned, and deburred them. I did not dimple them yet. I want to wait for prime to fully dry before that.

3 hours later, I finished cleaning most left ribs: center ribs (minus those with hinges), leading edge ribs, trailing ribs, and the landing light frame.

Some of them received primer today. Once they are dry I shot primer to the other half.

Here are all left ribs that received primer by the end of the day:

## Crack on rib

On `WG-RIB-304-L` I noticed a dent near a rivet hole. It looks like the rib was knocked by something during shipping. The dent was deep enough to create a crack.

I took a picture and sent to Sling technical. I don't know if a doubler of some sort would be ok to fix the crack, or if I need a new part. Since it hasn't been installed yet, a new part makes more sense to me.

Edit 6/42/2024: I emailed Sling technical and they suggested that I should get a new part. The crack is not removable and can only get larger. So I ordered replacement part which will be here in a few days.

## Vlog of first week building the wing

As I wrap up the first week of wing's build, I decided to change up the format of my blog a little. In the past I did time lapse and voice over. I don't think that's the most effective presentation to document what I did. So I stopped recording time-lapse. Instead, I just paused the build for a couple of minutes today and did a walk around to summarize my work. I liked this format a little more. I might keep doing it for future vlogs.
