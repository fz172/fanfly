## TLDR

- Lots of rivnuts on floor ribs
- Rib onto main spar

## Details

### Rivnuts

I installed rivnuts to all the ribs that goes onto the main spar. I think there are 30 of them.

_All riveted_

Riveting the ribs to the center box was a pain. The ribs were a tight fit to the box, and the holes were all just slightly misaligned and I needed to use an awl to wiggle the holes with quite a lot of force in order to get the rivets to fit.

And riveting the smaller ribs to main spar were also pretty painful, mainly because of the tight space could fit my rivet gun.
