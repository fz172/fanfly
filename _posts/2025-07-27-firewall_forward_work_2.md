- Installed the fule pump bracket

## Detail

### Fuel pump brakcet

The fuel pump bracket for my installation is slightly different from the instruction in the KAI.

In the KAI, the bracket is supposed to be installed in a upright position. For my naviflow set up, the fuel pumps needs to have its fittings sideways poining to the naviflow. So I need to install the bracket sideways.

The 4 mounting holes to the bracket is almost perfectly square, but with just a few millimeters offset. So they are actually a rectangle. To install the bracket sideways, I used dremel to slightly make the holes oval shape. The holes are squeeshed closer horizontally, and moved further apart vertically.

Adjusting the hole took a lot of time, as I don't want to make them too big. And in the process I broke several grommets.

When the hole and mounting bushing and screw all fit in the end, I used a multi-meter to test the continuity between the bracket and the airframe. There was none. Then I torqued down the locknuts to make it permanent.

### Fuel check valve research

#### Naviflow check valve

On the naviflow unit, there are 2 barb fittings to connect to a check valve. Interestingly the check valve I received from Sling has AN6 fittings. I think this is probably a new revision. They used to have 3/8 hose end fittings for 915, and switched to AN6 for 916 engines.  (My engine is 915 but the fireware kit I got was based on 915, that's aother issue).

So anyways, I sent a question to aero inno to ask about my options. I think I might have to get a new check valve with the barb fittings.

#### Main fuel pump check valve

And for the main cross fuel pump, the KAI says I need 2 low pressure check valve (0.4-0.7 PSI) but my kits included high pressure valves (0.8 PSI). I sent a question to technical, and they confirm they must be the low pressure version. So they also needed to be replaced.

### Mismatched parts in firewall forward kit

As I mentioned earlier, I am going to use 915 engine but my FWF kit is base don 916 engine. The two engines are almost identical externally but there are still some differences in installation. So I have a dozen parts I probably won't need, and some parts missing. I am in the process of re-inventorying everything and figure out what I am missing to actually install the 915 engine.
