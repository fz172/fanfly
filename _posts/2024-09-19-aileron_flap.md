## TLDR

- Fully riveted the left aileron and flap

## Details

### Steps

While waiting for the fuel tank to cure, I installed the left aileron and flap.

The process is exactly the same as the right side

- Pull a string across wing root and tip on the trailing edge for straightness
- Make sure aileron and flap lines to straight with the string
- rivet the front end if aileron and flap starting from the center and radiate outwards
- Then rivet countersunk rib rivets

It's a simple row of rivets, and even better I didn't need to touch any proseal :)

The process was quite pleasant and easy. I match drilled nothing on the flap, and match drilled a few countersink holes on the aileron. Overall they both came together pretty fast.

### Issue

The one issue I noticed is that there is some rubbing between the hinge and rivet at the wing tip when I wiggle the flag.

It goes away if I just push the flap towards the wing root side. I am guessing I can fix this by either slightly bending the hinge, or fit some washers when I do the final assembly.

This seems to be a common problem to some builders, so I am not super worried at this point.
