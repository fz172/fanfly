## Tasks completed

- instaled wiring and connector for the vertical stabilizer

## Details

### Wiring

I installed the wiring for the vertical stabilizer, which is required before closing the skin.

The wire that came with the kit is 18 awg shielded 4 conductor wire, but it's not long enough to make the connection. So I bought
additional ones from aircraft spruce.

Laying the wire in the assembly was straigh forward. The cable needs to go through 3 holes, 2 of which are already in the right size to install the grommet. I enlarged a hole on rib1 to 9mm and inserted the rubber grommet, then ran the wire across the VS.

### Connector

The wire needs 2 delphi connectors, one on each side to establish connection between fuselage and tail light. On the rudder side, I previously installed a male connector (4pin) so I needed a female connector on the VS top.

With the new crimper tools I bought, the install was relatively smooth.

After pinning the connector I tested the light again with 2x9v batterys, and everything still works.

I did not install connector on the other end. I want to leave this when I make the final assembly so I will know how much wire I need to cut.

### wire protection

Before closing the skin, I also put in edge protection and standoff to make sure the wire does not rub against the ribs or spars. I made the standoffs using zip-ties (see picture below).
