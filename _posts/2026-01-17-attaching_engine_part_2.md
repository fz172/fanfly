## TLDR

- Torqued engine mounting bolts

## Details

I came back to the hangar today and finished the remaining work for attaching the engine. All 4 bolts are now torqued.

### Difference in torque value

The Sling instruction calls for `38 nm` with oiled torque. In my initial installation I greased the bolts.

As I researched into difference in torque values, it turns out the the value is different between an oiled bolt and a greased bolt.

The grease is smoother, more sticky. So it's better at reducing friction when torquing compared to oil. So if I torque the bolt to 38nm when greased, it will be over torqued.

### Re-installing the bolts

There is in fact an conversion on torque values. I calculated 38nm oiled torque value would be 30nm greased torque value. But at this stage it's easy enough to start over instead of doing my own math.

So I removed the bolts one by one and cleaned them thoroughly. I dipped each bolt in engine oil, then reinstalled them with the proper torque.

I kept the factory provided nylon locknuts on the two top bolts, but switched to metal locknuts due to the heat concern.

Finally I applied torque stripe for all bolts.
