## TLDR

- Got help from family to fill rivets on the rear fuselage

## Details

Today I brought my wife and daughter to the hangar to help me fill rivets on the rear fuselage. It was a fun family activity.

I mixed the filler and showed them how to apply it to the rivet holes. They did a great job and we finished the entire rear fuselage in a few hours.
