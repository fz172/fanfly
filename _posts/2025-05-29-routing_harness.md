# TLDR

- Brake lines
- Routed the harness in center channel 

# Details

## Brake lines

They are AN3 fittings. I did my best to tighten them in the fuselage: 2 straight fittings to the bulkhead and one T in the center. All 4 connections were super difficult to tighten, I don't think I reached the needed torque. I might have to redo them again with better tools.

## Harness

I routed the harness from back to front in the center channel. There is not much to it except going slow zip tie by zip tie.

From online videos and photos a lot of people build custom L bracket to raise the harness vertically. I gave it some thought but decided against it. I dont think it will give me much benefit. The main thing I want to avoid is that I want to avoid the fuel line and harness crossing each other. As in: the fuel line eventually needs to bend up to reach the fuel selector, and the wires goes straight above the fuel lines. So it seems to me no matter what I do the fuel lines will cross with the harness. 

With zip ties, I think I reached a reasonable state: wires on the side, and fuel/brake lines at the center.

## Flap connector

Needed to make a custom holder to hold the flap connector in place.

I cut a 2" x 2.5" plate, punched a hole to feed the connector through, and riveted the plate to the flap motor rib.
