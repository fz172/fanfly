## TLDR

- Some prep work and clecoed rear fuselage and center fuselage floor

## Details

## Rudder tension spring

Installed two M5 rivnuts at the top end of the rear fuselage right under the luggage floor skin, and connected the rudder springs.

## Connecting the front floor to spar

First, test fitting -

Then I removed the floor to flip the spar 90 degrees.

## Control stop

When test fitting the control stop, had a problem with aligning the holes between the skin and control stop.

The holes from control stop is predrilled to 4mm, and the skin holes are pre-drilled to 3.2mm. I will have to match drill them to 4mm.

## Flap acuator support

Installed the flap actuator support on the center fuselage floor. I guess it's not necessary to do it now, but it provides some rigidity to the floor.

## Redoing 2 ribs

In previous step, I accidentally swapped rib 901-L and 902-L. That's the center two ribs connecting the rear and center fuselage.

So I had to unrivet these 2 ribs and swap them. This took me a good 1 hour to complete. After which I cleaned up the fuselage and reinstalled them the correct way.

## Clecoing fuselages

Then I put in some foam spacer on the rear end of the fuselage to create the proper angle needed, and clecoed the rear and center fuselages together.

I have not riveted them yet at this stage. I want to take a step back and really make sure I have not missed any steps, then I will probably rivet them together soon.
