# TLDR

- Workshop organization and clean up
- Had an EAA tech counsel on fuselage work

# Detail

## Clean up

Since I moved the fuselage into the hangar last week, I haven't really got a chance to organize my tools etc to their proper location. So I spent most of the day doing that and moping up the floor to keep the workspace clean.

## EAA Tech Counsel

My EAA tech counselor Jason visited my hangar in the afternoon to check out my work. And I took the opportunity to ask a bunch of questions related to AN fittings, avionics and wiring, and some other misc issues.

### Inspection on WIP fuselage and avionics

A few points:

- Tail harness - I have a wire loop near the elevator tube. That's probably fine but would be better to secure it even more so it's not possible to touch the tube.
- Electrical tape - don't use it. It gets gummy over time. Cable tie and/or silicone tape are better choices.
- Wire harness - no need to wrap anti-chaffing stuff between wire and cable tie. Cable bie won't chaff through Tefzel wires.
- AN Fitting torque - Use the "flat" method, it's easier than finding exact torque values.
  - Hand tighten, then use wrench to add a quarter turn.
- Testing wire harness: Avionics shop should have tested it. But just in case, I can test again (continuity test) wire by wire following the wire diagram.
- Wire routing: we found a few bundles of wire not fully secured so they can have movements during flight. Suggestion is to use cable tie to fix them to something rigid.
- Rudder cable clearance to surroundings: there is a very tight clearance between rudder cable to the center channel routing. I need more clearance for rudder cable. Once I can get more tension on the cable, I will be able to see where the cable goes, and then I can either put anti-chaff material, or cut away some material from the center channel routing.

Overall, I am relieved that no major issue was detected, and I think I can fix all the things pointed out!

On to the next fight!
