## Process

In the last few days I finished the rear spar on the horizontal stablizer (`HS-ASS-001-C-F-0` sheet 4).

It took a little longer than I thought to clean and debur, mainly because of the size of he parts.

But once primed, putting together was smooth.

I had to pay attention to the notes on the instruction where a few holes were not supposed to be riveted. So I marked them on the part and skipped them.

## Side track to elevator spar

The last part I riveted together was the elevator spar. 

And when flipping through instructions I realized I riveted the parts in the opposite direction as the KAI stated.

It was defintely a panic moment. I spent a few days to research online. I ended up purchasing a bunch of 3.2mm and 4mm Gesipa rivets from ebay in case I needed to drill them out and start over.

But in the end I think riveting in the opposite direction will not affect the strength of the parts. It *will* affect how easy it is to drill out the rivets in the future in case I need to replace them. I jumped ahead a few pages on the instruction and looked at Evan's video to get a sense what I will deal with. It seems most rivets will be covered by other parts soon. So it's probably not going to make a difference which way I put the rivets. There will be 8 or so still accessible after all parts come together. So I think I will drill them out and flip the side, but I will keep the rest in as is.
