# TLDR

- Installed the rear seat belts
- Installed the front seat belts

# Detail

Between yesterday and today, I installed all the seat belts.

## Rear seat belt

The rear set is simple. There are a few bolts to connect the seat belt, and I just bolted them on and torqued to spec. The only thing is that I needed to pay extra attention to make sure the belt did not twist or anything. And since I don't have the floor skin yet, so I had to be super light on my feet to avoid poking any hole on the floor.

## Front seat belt

### The spool retractor

Step 1 of the whole installation is that I needed to first unwind the seat belt from the retractor. The problem is, one of my retractors was fully locked. I couldn't back out any seat belt.

I googled around, and finally decided to open the retractor and manually release the locking mechanism. I pried the cover open and used a tiny screw to release the internal lock. Then I was able to unwind the seat belt.

The rest is pretty similar to what Evan talked about on his video - I used a ruler to block the retractor once the seat belt was fully out.

I took a bunch of pictures so I remember how to put it back.

### Bolting on the fuselage

Finally I bolted the 3 points onto the fuselage and canopy. The bolts are torqued to 20 NM per spec.
