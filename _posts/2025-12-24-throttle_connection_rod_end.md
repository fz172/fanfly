## TLDR

- Made a rod end nut to connect throttle cable and the throttle quadrant

## Details

Continuing from last week's work, I received the rod ends I bought from McMaster. I bought 2 kinds: 10-32 rod end, and a M5 rod end nut.

Turns out the throttle cable thread is M5, so I continued with the M5 rod end nut as the basis of today's work.

What I wanted to do is that the nut should be fitted to sit perfectly in the bushing on the throttle quadrant, and moves freely. And on the other end I want to connect it to the throttle cable.

The nut that came from McMaster had slightly smaller ID than the bushing. So I just ran a 1/4" drill bit and made the hole slightly bigger.

Another thing to fix: the nut was too thick. The nut's clevis part measured about 6 mm, but the bushing on my throttle quadrant was about 3.2mm. So I had to grind off a lot of material in order for the nut to fit on the bushing without extra material. It was not as bad as I thought. Using an angle grinder with 2 inch disc, it didn't take long to get close to the dimension I needed. Then I slowed down and just did some test fitting every few seconds of grinding.

After the parts fitted, I ran the final part through my bench grinder with a scotch wheel to debur and clean everything. Then it was installed onto the throttle quadrant with no problem.
