# TLDR

- Pulled rivets and fully closed rear fuselage

# Detail

There is not much to say really, I pulled a million rivets and fully closed the rear fuselage.

So I've had clecos on the rear fuselage for months by now, waiting for the canopy to be installed before riveting the rear fuselage. Now that the canopy is done, I was finally able to rivet in the rear fuselage.

The holes mostly lined up great. I needed to use my awl to wiggle a few holes to get the rivets in, but overall it was not too bad.

It took a lot of time though, just because of there were so many of them, and some of them are on top and it was not very easy to access since my fuselage was still on a table.
