## TLDR

- Adjusted fuel selectors and routed fuel lines

## Details

### Planning

To route the fuel lines through the co-pilot side under the dashboard, I've been thinking a few options.

1. Drill 2 holes on the side panel near the fuel selector and the rudder pedal, then feed the fuel lines through so large part of them go inside the center channel. I eventually decided against this approach because of the tight space inside center channel, and I don't want to bend the fuel lines excessively.
2. Adel clamp the lines against the angle bracket that mounts the side panel. So the lines goes almost flat from the fuel selector to the firewall, then take a 45 degree turn and exit to the firewall forward.

### Adjusting the fuel selector

To make the fuel lines closer to the angle brackets, I had to rotate the fuel selector so the feed/return lines on top of the selector are less protruded out of the center channel.

To do this, I uninstalled the fuel selector, rotated it 45 degrees, then reinstalled it. This makes the fuel selector's LEFT side points to left, RIGHT side points up, and OFF side points to the right. Not ideal, but better than messy fuel lines I suppose.

### Routing the fuel lines

The entire routing really just took 3 M4 rivnuts and 3 adel clamps. However the location for these are extremely difficult to access. I spent a whole 4 hours to drill, prep, install the rivnuts. I'm a skinny person. If I'm fatter I'm not sure I can even get into the tight space under the dash.

Anyways, after 4 hours of pain, I got the fuel lines routed. it looks much more acceptable now.
