## TLDR

- Started to install ECU
- Made some tools to better bleed the brake

## Details

### ECU

I started to install ECU under the dashboard today.

The unit is supported by 4 screws. For some reason two of them were not long enough. So I could not complete the installation today.

I tried the screws on a tester, and looks like they were 10-32 hex screws. So I ordered a few long ones from Amazon. Once they arrive I will resume the work.

For now, the unit is temporarily supported with 2 screws fully installed, and another one installed without a washer so it could barely bite the threads.

### Brake Bleeding Tool

I ordered a oil spout, and a pressure pump on Amazon last night to increase the pressure going into the bleeding valve.

At the same time, I'm not happy with how to line connected to the bleeding valve on my first try. So I decided to rebuild the lines and connect to the pump when they arrive.

The idea is this:

- Bleed Valve -> 1/4 OD brake line -> 90 Degree coupler -> 5/32 od line -> Pump.

I have a few 90 degree coupler available, so I put them together quickly.

I used a heat gun to blow the tip warm, then put it on the bleeding valve to get an exact fit.

I connected the other end with a super long line so I can stand next to one wheel and pump the fluid to the other when bleeding.
