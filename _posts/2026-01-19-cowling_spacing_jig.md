## TLDR

- 3D modeled a jig to ensure cowling spacing from propeller flange

## Details

Engine is on, so I started to plan what I need to do on the cowling fitting.

I decided to make a jig on the prop flange to ensure the exact spacing between the prop and front of the cowling.

The jig will be 3d printed. Once I test the jig, I will publish it here for other builders to share.

To build the jig, I took some measurements of the cowling.

The front hole measures about 8.22 inch. And I will use the published data on Rotax installation manual to model the bolt holes holding the jig to the propeller flange.

The idea is that the jig will be connected to the engine's prop flange through the holes on the smallest plate. And the medium sized plate has the same diameter as the cowling front hole so the cowling can rest on the jig when fitting. And the outer circle has the same diameter of the cowling front hole OD for easy alignment.
