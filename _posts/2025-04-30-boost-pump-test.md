# TLDR

- Tested leak on boost pump plumbing

# Detail

I conducted a leak test on the boost pump plumbing today. Unfortunately, both wings have leak on the rigid flare lines connecting the fuel port and the filter.

## Test set up

The test set up is very similar to fuel tank set up, except that I don't have as much space, and I don't need to measure the precise pressure.

I bought the follow stuff:

- Seal the fuel overflow tube
  - 1/4 pneumatic to NPT fitting
  - 1/4 NPT Cap
- Seal the pump AN6 tube
  - AN6 Cap
- Connect the fuel return port to a tyre pump fitting
  - Tire pump fitting
  - NPT to AN6 female fitting
  - AN6 male-male fitting

Then I blocked off the fuel overflow and fuel pump line, and connected tyre pump to the fuel return. It's not possible to pump air through the boost pump lines, because the pump is one-way only.

### Test result

Unfortunately I found leak on the flare tubing connection. I suspected this part might leak because when I received the flare tube it's very rough.

It's not very difficult to make a new one. I will do that soon. It's hopefully just a small issue. But plumbing always give me tremendous anxiety.
