## TLDR

- Rebuilt the door latch on passenger side

## Detail

I wasn't happy with the latching motion on the passenger side door since I installed it last month. Today I decided to redo the latch.

I took off the rolling pin holding the lock/latch, and re-measured the position for the rolling pin. Then I drilled a new hole and put the pin back. It's abou3 millimeters next to the original position, but the locking motion is a lot smoother. Once the door is locked, there is no movement on the latch at all. This feels a lot safer than my previous installation. I used some structural epoxy to fill the original hole. I am much happier about the new installation.
