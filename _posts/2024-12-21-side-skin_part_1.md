## TLDR

- Cleco-ed side skin to fuselage
- And riveted some non-essential parts

## Details

So I need to install the side skin (and possibly the firewall) before continue with the joystick, because the joystick sits between center fuselage and the rear fuselage. I need to get the two parts connected and at their final position to ensure the connection angle is finalized. Otherwise I won't know for sure how much more shaving I need to do on the joystick bushing channels.

### Left side

I have already previously dimpled ths skins but missed the top row on both sides. So I did that, and fitted all doublers and stringers on the left side first to see if everything makes sense.

_Fitting the side skin on the left side_

It turns out the doubler holes were all drilled to 4mm, and the stringers and skins drilled the hole on the same position at 3.2mm. So I disassembled the pieces and match drilled about 15 holes on each side so they would take 4mm rivets instead.

_Test fitting the doublers on the outside because it's easier to access_

The holes on the bottom were super difficult to line up. I had to muscle it quite a bit, but in the end I got the clecos to get in. I expect some clear drilling when I start to rivet the bottom part.

### Right side

After doing the left side, I did the same on the right side.

_Low on clecos, I only put in a few just to hold the skin in place_

_Very exciting to see both skins on both sides_
