## TLDR

- Rough cut the window on pilot side door

## Details

Last time when I went to the hangar I brought back home the pilot/copilot side doors, windows and the tools for making the windows. So I am able to work on the door windows at home rather than having to go to the hangar :)

This evening after work I started to work on the pilot side door.  I followed the same process as rear windows, and attached the window to the door and drew the outline with a expo marker. But just before that, I had to remove the door lock handle so nothing is in the way to fit the window.

After the outline was drawn, I used my die grinder to cut it execessive pieces.  I staerted to fine tune and sand down the window, but didn't quite finish today. Planning to continue over the weekend.
