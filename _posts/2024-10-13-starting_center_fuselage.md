## TLDR

- Built the rear spar
- Installed autopilot brackets on main spar

## Details

I've decided skip ahead and work on the center fuselage while waiting for Sling technical's advise on RF floor skin.

## Rear spar

Standard process - I deburred, cleaned all parts for the rear fuselage, and then just riveted them together.

I used a few AN bolts to ensure the holes are all lined up as I riveted the plates together.

From the instruction, it's unclear whether I should rivet a few holes towards the edge. I just left them for now.

## Main spar autopilot brackets

There are 3 brackets to be installed on the main spar. Two of them are pretty easy, and the last one requires four M4 bolts. The position of the nuts are extremely tricky to get to. It took me about a full hour to bolt them in place.
