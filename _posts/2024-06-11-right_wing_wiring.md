## TLDR

- Laid out wiring harness in the right wing
- Built connectors
- Tested continuity

## Details

Call me slow but a 30 minutes job turned into 4 hours across 2 days.

I thought feeding wires through the stringer channel would be easy. It wasn't!

### Feeding wires

I needed to feed the hardness wire through the 2 little holes from the wing root ribs, then through the entire length of the stringer.

Each rib slightly blocks the wire, and I didn't want to pull too hard and accidentally break any wire. So the entire process was pretty slow.

After the wire is through, the OAT wires that was supposed to near the insepection hatch was too far from it, so I tug it closer. But it made the wire left at the root very small. After considering my options, I decided to keep the wing root wire longer and the pulled OAT wire further away from the inpsection hatch. My thought process is that I can make some extension wire for the OAT if needed. But making extension for the wire at the wing root would be a lot harder.

### Tie down and edge protector

I used the zip ties that came with the kit to tie the wire along the stringer. It worked well.

Then I cut some edge protectors and added to the entire length of the stringer, as well as the opening for each rib. I think the ones on the rib might be ore important as they are more likely to chaff against the wire.

### OAT connector

After all the wire is position, I began to build a Delphi GT150 connector for the OAT probe.

Midwest Panel Builders sent me the schematic for the wing hardness, so all I had to do was to match the wire to a 4 pin GT150 connector.

_Female connector_

For the male end, I'm really not very fast at building electrical stuff. Connecting the 4 wires took me about 2 hours to complete. I needed to:

- Strip 4 18AWG wires both ends
- Pring label for each wire
- head shrink the label onto the wire
- Crimp the wire to GT 150 pins
- Asemble the GT150 connector

Then, I connected the male/female connectors, and used a multi-meter to test the continuity between the pigtail end and the wing root connector. Everythihng worked!! Time to package it up and store safely for the OAT probe in the near future!!
