## Tasks completed

* Installed right leading edge

## Details

The new rivet gun has arrived. I tried it on a few spare rivets and it worked. So I proceeded to rivet the right leading edge skin.

*Here we go!*

The process is pretty standard. Cleco -> Plant rivet -> Pull rivet -> repeat.

*Replace cleco with rivet*

The only tricky point is that I needed to make sure the main spar countersink enforcement strip is installed correctly. ie, every hole on the enforcement should have a rivet going through it.

As I riveted each one, I checked from inspection hatch that the rivet went through all holes correctly. In particular, the rivets needed to go through: top skin, main skin, main spar, enforcement strip. It's a big sandwich.

Occasionally I had some friction getting the rivets to go into the hole. I gave them a gentle push with a hard plastic tube, and they all went in no problem.

*All done*

I left the rightmost row on cleco per the instruction. I believe this row will be used to install the fuel tank later on. We will see.
