# TLDR

- Test fitted the instrument panel to dashboard
- Installed rivnuts to dashboard doubler


# Details

With most of the things surrounding the instrument panel completed, I am close to finally installing the panel.

I put the panel onto the dashboard, and clecoed the holes through panel + leather dashboard + MPB panel doubler all together. And to my satisfaction they all line up perfectly.

I match drilled them to 4mm, then pulled them apart to install M4 rivnuts on the doubler. I took extra care to ensure the direction of the doubler was correct so the rivnuts were all facing towards the pilot side.

Then I put them all back together and installed a few M4 screws to hold them together. They are rigid enough for the next step (onto the airplane).
