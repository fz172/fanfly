## Tasks completed

- Right botoom skin clecoed, and test fitted most rivets
- Drilled almost all of the rivets from left

## Bottom skin

I spent some time to cleco and test fit the bottom skin on the left wing.

The process is fairly standard, cleco, test fit every hole, remove cleco and try again. I reepeated this process 3 times until most holes lined up without match drilling.

_The rest of the wing with cleco and rivets for test fitting_

I inserted rivets to every hole (where I am supposed to rivet) except the center stringer. I am pretty sure I will have to match drill the stringer, so I did not bother align the holes perfectly. They still mostly aligned after clecoing, but rivets would not go in without significant force. I will leave the match drilling to the end when I am done riveting the main botom skin.

### What'd done different compared to the right wing

1. I did the wiring differently on the left. Instead of riveting everything and threading the wire harness, I laid the harness into the stringer before even clecoing this time. I had more space to work with, and things went faster.
2. I inserted the aileron tube before installing rib 8 and beyond. Same reason, I had more space to work with.
3. I rolled the edge on the skin. I did not do this on the right side, and people on the sling builder group said it's fine. But a few folks who did it said it made fuel tank fitting easier. So I rolled the skin edge while it's still available.

## Deriveting the right leading edge

I continued my progress to remove rivets from the right leading edge.

It's not difficult, but I had to be very careful to avoid even further damage. I also made very slow progress because each drill reminded me of the silly mistake. So I just really didn't want to do it.

Anyhow, I am almost done withe the top side. Only 5 rivets left. I will need some help (and more imporantly, space) to flip the wing and do the back side. I supposed I have some time because the replacement part hasn't arrived yet.

## Space planning

The fuselage kit is on the way, but my garage is completely full at this point. I am thinking I will need to use some vertical space.

Maybe I will put the fuse kit on the floor, then wing crate on top. I will need to finish the wing kit, then dispose the huge empty crate, then I will probably have space to work the fuse.

Lots of moving parts, for sure!
