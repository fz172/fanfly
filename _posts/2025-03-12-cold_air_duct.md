## TLDR

- Installed air duct near nose

## Details

A couple of weeks ago I 3D printed a better designed duct connecting the naca port and the internal air flow pipes. I finally got around installing them.

Like many other builds, I am not going to use the standard duct routing from the sling factory. Instead, I will use the existing route just for code air. And I will run the warm air through center channel.

So for the code air side, I literally just need to put in the 3d printed adapter, and connect it on the side skin channel.

I applied some Sika 221 along the duct and near the side skin for added sealing.

The factory side channel has two fairly complicated pipe that's supposed to connect warm air. Since I'm not going to use it for warm air, I just cut it off using a dermal grinding bit.

Then glued it to the duct and side skin.
