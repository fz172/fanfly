# TLDR

- Installed air duct near nose

# Details

A couple of weeks ago I 3D printed a better designed duct connecting the naca port and the internal air flow pipes. I finally got around installing them.

Like many other builds, I am not going to use the standard duct routing from the sling factory. Instead, I will use the existing route just for code air. And I will run the warm air through center channel.

So for the code air side, I literally just need to put in the 3d printed adapter, and connect it on the side skin channel.

I applied some Sika 221 along the duct and near the side skin for added sealing.
