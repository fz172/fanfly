## TLDR

- Test fitted the center console
- Installed headset plugs on center console

## Details

### Test fitting center channel

I have built the center channel a long time ago. Today I finally got to test fit it onto the airplane.

It went on pretty easy. The only gotcha is that the safety belt needed to go through the sides of the console, so I needed to first detach part of the safety belt, feed it through the skin, then reattach it to the plane.

I clecoed the whole thing in place but couldn't find the right rivet (4.8 countersink), so I placed an order with Sling and will just wait for the rivets before installing it permanently. In fact this is probably better, I am not done with routing wires yet, it's possible I need to take it off.

### Headset plugs

I installed the pilot/copilot headset on the console. Pretty easy this time as there is no weird grounding issue, all wires are pinned correctly.

I usd a dib of loctite 222 on each plug's nut to make sure they don't fall apart. And then I tested continuity, all seemed to be ok.
