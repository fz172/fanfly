# TLDR

# Detail

## Air vent sealant

So on the top channel of the side skin I am supposed to put some sealant to help the air flow from naca duct to reach the rear passengers.

I used Sikaflex 221 for this job. It doesn't need to super precise so it wasn't as painful as the fuel tank building process.

I used the standard calk gun to apply a bead of the sealant along the channel, then smeared it flat using a popsicle stick.

## Sound proof

I basically just traced the shape of side skin and cut the sound proof foam to fit.

Fairly simple task, but again somehow too me all night to do. And I ran out of sound proofing foam so I was not able to finish the job. Pretty close to complete though.

I also vacuumed the floor for tiny dirts a I attached the foam.
