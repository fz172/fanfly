## Wiring & harness

I continued to connect and clean up harness throughout the fuselage, more focusing on the avionics rack.

So the last harness I placed is the "main" harness that goes through the entire fuselage. And the latest harness I am working on is the rack harness. Most of it stays on the rack and connects with various avionics, VPX, relays, that sort of stuff.

With this harness in, I am able to see more clearly how long each wire needs to be. I might need to loosen up the main harness and adjust some wires.

## Flap connector

The connector for the flap motor was not pre-installed. They gave me a few wires pre-crimped with the pins, but I needed to match the wire on the flap motor and assemble the CPC connector. With the wire diagram I was given, this was pretty straightforward.

_Flap motor connected_

And I zip tied extra wires on the motor itself. They seem to be fine sitting there. I might cut them shorter before installing the center console permanently. We will see.

## Antennas & GPS'es

Also worked on crimping some BNC connectors: Rack end of the comm1 and fuselage end of the XPDR. With that, I was able to finish the XPRD antenna part of the build.

I also installed the GPS on top of the luggage area. I needed to cut away a small chunk of the carpet to make the bolts through. Once the antenna is installed I will cut a new piece of carpet to patch it up.
