# TLDR

- Installed the rear seat stopper plates

# Detail

With the audio jacks fixed, the wires are in their permanent place. So I went ahead and installed the rear seat stoppers (had to wait because they are so close to the wires).

The two seat stoppers very much did not align with the holes on the fuselage. I was only able to put rivets without match drilling. For the rest of the holes, I needed to make a doubler and match drill to make the plate connect with the fuselage without distorting.
