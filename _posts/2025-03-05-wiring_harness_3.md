# TLDR

- Installed the shunt
- Continued to tidy up wire harness
  - Cable tied everything on the left rear of main spar
  - Connected power to cabin overhead
  - Connected tail harness
  - Connected GSA 28 for elevator
- Pneumatic lines

# Details

## Shunt

All holes are pre-drilled on the firewall. I added a few rivnuts and screwed the shunt, done.

## Wires

I spent a significant amount of time tidying up the wires. Still not done yet, but made some progress.

Nothing is particularly difficult, but extremely time consuming. I ran the wires back and forth a few times to make sure they have enough length on both ends (rack, and wherever they need to be). And I started to cable tie everything from back to front.

_Tail harness connectors_

### Cabin overhead wires

4 wires from the harness needs to connect with the cabin overhead wires to power the cabin lights.

I elected to use GT150 delphi connector just because I have a few in my tool box. The process was slow due to spacing, but pretty straight forward following the wire diagram from MWPB.

## Pneumatic lines

Also connected the pneumatic plumbing in order to finalize the length needed to run through the center channel.
