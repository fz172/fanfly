# TLDR

- Built the door latch pushrod

# Detail

With the GMU11 issue on pause waiting for parts, I switched to working on doors.

THe first task on the KAI is to build the door latch pushrod.

It's a big metal rod with 2 fork things on each end, connected to two latch catches.

## Rollpin

The only difficult part during this process was that the catches are connected to the fork using a rollpin. It was super difficult to get the tiny rollpin into the hole.

I tried quite a few times and finally managed to get them in. As the roll pin goes in, it pinches the fork, which in turn makes the movement of the catch more stiff. I think I need to make the rollpin back up a little so the fork has more space.

## The square hole

Another thing is that the square hole on the catch just didn't fit the provided lock at all. I had to grind the hole a little with a dremel. 

## The assembly

Looking ahead for the final assembly onto the door, I guess I just don't understand how they fit together.

Oh the KAI there is a CA-PLT-001-X lock stability bushing. I don't have this part.. I tired to build my own by copying the shape from the KAI. But I am not sure what's the purpose of this part.. More research needed.
