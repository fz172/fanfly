Following the countersink [mistake I made](https://fanfly.dev/posts/hs_spar/) a few weeks ago, I
ordered and received the replacement angle `HS-ANG-001-X-E-2`.

With rudder finished and VS blocked partially by the defective part, I switched my attention back to 
the horizontal stablizer front spar this week, focusing on `HS-ASS-001-C-F-0` sheet 2, 3.


## Countersinking

I first marked the countersink positions, and double checked this time I'm marking the correct side :)

Then I adjusted the countersink tool using a flush rivet.  The issue, however, is that when I try to fit
the dimpled spar with the countersunk holes, the spar sits proud of the angle by quite a bit. See picture below.

Since the dimple came from the factory, I'm pretty sure it's not caused by my own dimple skills. 

I didn't like the gap between the 2 layers but was a little hesitant to keep counter sinking. It was already not
a standard depth for putting flush rivets. I took a caliper to measure the remaining depth of the angle to
make sure there was more than 60% left in the countered hole, and there was.  So I drilled a few thousands (5 maybe?).
The gap situation became a lot beter after that.

## Matching holes

Then I started to cleco the spar,stiffener, and the angle plates together. I started from the center and tried to radiate outwards.
Pretty soon I found the holes were super not aligned. I think what happened was that the stiffener was not aligned when I put the
first cleco, and it kinda just got stuck. 

I took apart all clecos, and started over. The second time I just focused on aligning holes on one side first, then moved on to the
other side. This worked much better.

## Measuring twist

On Evan's video and also from the instruction I know they want me to check twist at a later step. But given the worried on twist I had when
building rudder, I just pulled out the level laser and did a quick measure on the front spar. I put it on the ground, and shot the laser from 
one side to the other passing through the center rivet holes. It aligned perfectly so I was very happy.

## Riveting

This was the easy part and also the fun part. I marked the few holes that I was not supposed to rivet, and went at it. It was done within a few minutes.

## Result

I think I have finished everything on page 3. I took a few pictures. Long weekend is coming, and I hope I will find some time to cleco front and rear spar together this weekend and check their twist.
