# TLDR

- Talked to Steve from Midwest Panel Builders about my panel's configuration

# Details

I called Steve from Midwest Panel Builders to discuss a few things on my panel configuration.

- Render shows 2 G3X units, I only have one.

- Tail number unsure, can we not engrave it on the panel
- Fuel pump upgrade questions
  - Do I need a boost pump switch on the panel?
  - Harness: will it be built into the main harness?
  - Fuel pump order status?
- GPS unit: confirm it's 375?
- Bottom row of swtiches, are they on/off type? Why do I need a Auto-pilot switch when I already have GMC 507
- Wing harness question: it's too short, extension harness?
- Fuel level sender question: one of the sender is reversed. Can I fix in G3X or do I have to rebuild?
