# TLDR

- Installed naca duct

# Detail

I placed the naca duct on the fuselage, and match drilled 2.4mm holes.

The naca duct is _very_ thin. Iâ€˜m not sure countersinking is safe enough here. I plan to put some washer behind it to provide more gripping power for the rivets. And I will most definitely use some proseal to glue the duct on the skin.
