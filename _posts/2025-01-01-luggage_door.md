## Luggage door

With most of the rear fuselage clecoed, I put on the luggage door (also just clecoed).

The frame and stiffening angles are easy to put together. The door itself took a little effort. It comes as a flat aluminum sheet, and I need to bend slightly so it matches the curvature of the fuselage.

The instruction gave the measurements of where to bend. I drew a line along the bending measurements and used my knee to bend it. It just needs to be bent slightly, so I did it very slowly.

## Seat stop brackets

Then I clecoced the rear seat stop brackets next to the luggage door.

The holes are pre-punched and the access is easy. But it's super confusing how to orient the pieces. The KAI's drawing was not very helpful. I searched the part number on Facebook builder group and found a picture. Then I just followed what everyone else did and clecoed mine.

It seems these pieces will need to come off to make room for wiring harness later, so I will just keep them clecoed for now.
