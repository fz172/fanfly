## TLDR

- Connected tube for the static ports
- Ran wire for comm1 antenna
- Installed luggage floor
- Partially assembled parachute box
- Installed longeron 111 and antenna doublers

## Details

Last week I used some fragmented time to work on small tasks. I think I've reached a point that I can close the rear fuselage skin, or at least can cleco them shut for a test fit.

### Static port tubes

I ordered a 20 ft blue tube from Stein air, and cut to two parts: the shorter part
connects the 2 static ports, and the longer part goes through the RF and will be
connected to the panel in the future.

### Coax cable

Similar to the static tube, I also ran the coax cable for com1 through under the luggage
floor area.

### floor & parachute box

#### Floor skin

I riveted the stringers in place for the floor area. A few holes need to be match drilled.

_Floor stringers_

Then I riveted the floor skin onto the strings.

As I mentioned on previous log, the floor flanges are too tall and I have a 3mm gap
between the bottom of flange an the top of longeron.

I asked Sling technical and other builders. Apparently this is common and cosmetic
only. So I man-handled the floor and riveted everything together.

#### Parachute box

This is supposed to be an easy task, but as everything goes in this build
nothing is easy :) I am missing a skin piece on the parachute box. So I can only
partially assemble the box and install what I can.

I riveted two out of the three pieces of the parachute box onto the floor. I think
I will have enough clearance to install the last piece when it arrives. I also have
the cable tray clecoed in place to keep some rigidity for rib 2 and rib 3.

### Longeron 111

This is the longeron on the very top of all ribs, and also carriers the doubler for the COMM1 radio.

I assembled the doublers and angles onto the longeron and installed the longeron to Rib 3.
