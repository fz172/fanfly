## Tasks

* Fixed rib 9 rivet clearance
* Cleaned a bunch of parts for right top skin
* Started dimpling


## Details

### Rib 9

I got an answer back from Sling on the rivet clearance issue on rivet 9.

They suggested to cut a slot to provide more clearance.

The space is so tight, so I bought a set of needle file and tiny dremel heads for the work.

I first drilled a tiny hole on the rib, then switched to a dremel head to enlarge the hole and made it into a slot. After that, I used needle file to clean up everything.

*Here is the final result*


### Cleaning and dimping parts

Finally it's time for the right top skin.

There are 5 stringers, 2 angles and 2 skins that I needed to clean.

The stringers and angles are fine, but I literally spent 2 hours to peel off the plastic on the top skin. It was just brutal. The process involved a lot of cursing.

*Starting to dimple the top skin*

I started to dimple the top skin, but peeling off the plastic just drained all my energy. I will complete the dimpling in another session.


## Special note about rear channel rivet direction

When riveting rear channel a few days ago I had to rivet 2 top rows from the opposite direction. 

I don't think they will create a clearance problem to the aleron or flaps, but I will keep an eye before riveting the top skin. If the rivets are enclosed by the skin, then I should have no problem proceeding.
