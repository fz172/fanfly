## Details

### Wing kit is on the way!

After a long pause, my Wing kit and a bunch of other components have finally arrived at Los Angelas last week. TAF is working on shipping them to me via truck.

I can't wait to get started on the wing.

I have been using my down time to read up on proseal. From what I've read so far, not really looking forward to that part :)

### Tools

There are always more tools to buy!

I bought a few tools to make my build easier: stubby socket set, AN sized wrench set, ez turn, isopropyl alcohol (trying it out as replacement to simple green). And I bought a hard copy of AC 43-13-1B/2B as handy reference.

### Dimple template

I did do some real hands-on work this week. In anticipation of the hundreds of countersinks on wing spar, I made 2 dimples on a piece of scrap aluminum, one 3.2mm and the othe 4.0mm. My plan is to use them as gauge to ensure my countersink on wing spar is at the right depth during that step of the build.

It took me 10 minutes to create the template. I took it slow as I refreshed my memory and skills on using the tools. It was a good exercise.
