## TLDR

- Removed right leading edge
- Dimpled replacement leading edge
- Riveted a few solid rivets for trailing edge

## Details

### Leading edge

I was busy this week and didn't spend much time on the build unfortunately. I managed to put in a few hours and finally got the right leading edge off the wing asembly today!

I vacuumed the assembly thoroughly. Hopefully all rivet butts got out. I also gently shook and tapped the wing skin, could not hear any rattling sound.

I deburred, dimpled and cleaned the replacement right leading edge as well as the left leading edge this week.

As you can see the space is getting crammed. I need to put them on the wing and make space for fuel tank work.

### Trailing edge

And I also spent some time to play with my new toy - a pneumatic squeezer.

I adjusted the pressure to 90PSI and made sure the dies have a gap of 1/8" when squeezed. This is the distance suggested by cleveland tools.

I tried to squeeze many rivets on scrap aluminum and then squeezed a few on the wing trailing edge. It's more frustrating than I anticipated. The squeezer really wanted to bend the rivets instead of mushrooming them. I had to position the rivets perfectly centered to make the squeezed shop end look OK. There is a 50% it would bend.

_Tilted_

_Less tilted, but still_

I asked on Sling builder group and also searched around on Vans group. It seems this is a common thing when using squeezers. Folks on Sling facebook group suggested checking if the squeezer is flexing (pretty sure it is) and replace the yoke pin with bolt, or use a shorter rivet. I will do both and see if I get any improvement. And obviously I will keep practicing on spare aluminum.

The rivet looked good, but I feel like the shop end is still too long. I will pause here and get some -3 rivets on the rest of the trailing edge.

## Last week's video

And I made a video to summarize my work lsat week. Here it is.
