# TLDR

- Installed the elevator push rod


# Details

So when I installed the elevator, I didn't install the eyebolt. In retrospective, it would have been much easier to install the eyebolt when the elevator is off the airplane.

Anyways, I spent about an hour to install the eyebolt. It took really long due to the tight spacing. I had to maneuver carefully to insert the washers and torque the eyebolt correctly.

Once the eyebolt was on, connecting the elevator with the long pushrod was easy enough. I did a moving range test. When the control stick is all the way forward (elevator full down), the joystick touches the instrument panel.

I think I might need to. adjust some pushrods either tighter or looser. I haven't figured out which one to adjust yet. This might become a experimental things and I just have to try a few different adjustments.
