## TLDR

- Noticed an issue with engine mount
- Prepped the rudder rod leather boot

## Detail

## Engine mount

Today I was checking the bolts installed on the engine mount, and found that the washer on the lower two bolts were hanging freely. As in the bolts were not pulled in tightly. I think this is because the bolts were too long and the nut ran out of threads.

I verified this by adding a washer next to the nut, and of course the bolt could then be pulled in tightly.

I don't want to stack two washers on this assembly, so I ordered a few shorter bolts from aircraft spruce. Once received I will replace the lower two bolts.

### The rudder control rod leather boots

Seemingly small tasks always takes more time to complete. I tried to install the leather boot on the rudder control rod in 15 minutes, and it turned into almost 2 hours work :-P

First I needed to align the leather with a thin plate and drill the matching holes on the leather. Then I clecoed the leather and plate together onto the firewall.

Since the firewall is already installed, clecoing the boots required some really awkward positioning. It took me a long time to find each match drilled holes.
