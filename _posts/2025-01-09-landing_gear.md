## TLDR

- Installed the landing gear

## Detail

Big day! I installed the landing gear with help from my wife. It's a happy sight to see that it's a step closer to get off the table and stand on its own!

We put two saw horses on each side of the fuselage and a bunch of foam on top to raise the landing gear to fit into the fuselage channel.

Then I inserted the 4 bolts pretty much exactly as the instruction said. All of them are tight fit but went in no problem.

After installation, I noticed there is a gap between the landing gear and the channel longitudinally on the left side. The gap is 1.0mm. I'm pretty sure the maximum allowed gap is 0.5mm, so I guess I will make a shim to remove the gap. Shouldn't be a big deal though.
