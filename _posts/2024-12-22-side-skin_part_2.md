## TLDR

- Riveted most of the side skin

## Details

Today I spent a few hours riveting the side skins.

So far I have all except one set of stringers riveted.

The set that sits closets to the rear fuselage behind the side skin ribs are not yet riveted. The 4.0mm holes that's supposed to go through the side ribs and the stringers are not lining up perfectly, so I am leaving those off for now. I don't want to match drill new holes here because it's right behind the reinforcement plates. I am thinking I will line up the 4.0 hole first, then maybe match drill a few 3.2mm holes on the other parts of the same stringer.

I also have not riveted the holes connecting center fuselage and rear fuselage. Some holes are slightly misaligned. I am considering my options before riveting.
