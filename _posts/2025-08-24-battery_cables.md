## TLDR

- Rebuilt battery cables
- Installed shunt cover
- Got confused about avionics error message

## Detail

## Battery cable

I decided to redo a segment of the battery cable - from master contact to the shunt.

The previous cable was working, but the way it was routed interfered with installing the shunt cover, so I made a new one.

Process was pretty straighforward:

- Rough measured  & and cut the cable length
- Crimped one side
- Bent the cable and test fitted it on the airplane
- While on the airplane, I "clocked" the other end of the cable lug, and marked the position using a sharpie.
- Crimped the other side.

With the cable properly routed, I installed the shunt cover. The only tricky part was to identify the correct position to drill the screw holes on the shunt.

I laid a piece of paper on the airplane and poked the holes on top of the rivnuts. Then I transferred the hole position from the paper to the cover, then then drilled away.
