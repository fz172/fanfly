## TLDR

- Installed upholstery: front seat back

## Detail

### Seat upholstery

Today when I visited the hangar my original intention was to finish installing the boost pump, but as it turns out I didn't have enough adel clamp and I forgot to bring thread sealant. I decided to work on upholstery.

The instruction on upholstery has always been super unclear, but the part of seat leather is pretty ok.

The install is pretty simple, I just need to put the velcro at the right place.

### Throttle quadrant vinyl

I printed out the svg pics using the Cricut machine, and tested on my throttle quadrant.

The "Throttle" and "Brake" label worked relatively ok, but the parking value label totally failed. The fonts I chose are way too small, I couldn't weed the letters off the vinyl sheet. I will need to redesign this with bigger fonts and try again.
