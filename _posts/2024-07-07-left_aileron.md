- Replace a M4 screw with striped head (on pitot control box)

## Fuselage kit

The timing couldn't have been better. I am just finishing up the wing kit as I got the call from the shipping company for fuselage delivery.

I still have a a lot to do on the wing, but there were few enough parts that I could just take them out and get rid of the crate to make space for the fuselage.

With help from my dad, we cleaned the wing crate and moved it out of the garage this Friday.

Later in the afternoon, the shipping truck arrived with my fuselage. The unloading process could have been better. **Sling if you are reading this blog, please consider redesign the crate. gap betweenb the 4x4 wooden leg on the crate is too wide, the trucking company's forklift could not reach in. It's just a few centimeter's difference, but it made things so much harder**

Eventually we got the crates into the garage. And also came with was the replacement right wing leading edge. So I will finish drilling out the old leading edge and replace it some time soon.

_Good bye wing crate, hello fuselage_

Then I did a quick inventory. The crate came with a long printout of backordered parts. I entered the parts onto the SlingShot (an app for sling builders to track invetory). I will wait for Sling folks to get back to me on those parts. Fortunately I still have a lot ot work on the wing, so none of the parts are immediately blocking.

## Prepping left aileron and flap parts

### Wing next steps overview

With fuselage waiting, I wanted to speed up on the wing build. The rough sequence for my next items are:

```mermaid
flowchart TB;
    Aileron["Left Aileron"]-->Flap["Left flap"];
    Flap-->TopSkin["Close top skin"];
    TopSkin-->Align["Align left aileron and flap"];
    Align-->TailingRivet["Close right trailing edge rivets"];
    TailingRivet-->LeadingEdge["Replace right leading edge"];
    LeadingEdge-->Align2["Align right aileron and flap"];
    Align2-->FuelTanks["Both fuel tanks"];
```

Phew, still a lot to do.

### Aileron and Flap parts prepping

Pretty standard stuff, I removed plastic from all relevant parts, deburred and scuffed, then cleaned with alcohol. Then I dimpled and primed all ribs.

### Building the aileron

I dimpled all the ribs and skin using 4.0mm dimple die set.

Then I clecoed the bottom side first to test the fit.

_Clecoed bottom skin_

On the Rib 7 side, the skin was perfectly straight.

_Straight on rib 7_

But on the rib 1 side, the skin bows downwards.

_Bends downwards on rib 1_

This happened on the right aileron too. I did the same as on the right side. I removed clecos and reinserted them one at a time from both sides, and carefully match drilled the holes to reduce the bending.

The final result: it still bends but much less obvious.

After aligning the edge on both ends, I riveted the parts together. I left the leading edge entire row and all countersink rivets off so the assembly remains flexible. I will align the part on the wing, then rivet them all together.
