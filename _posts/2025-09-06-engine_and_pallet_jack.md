## Details

### Engine

It's been an exciting week! I received the engine from the shipping company.

The engine shipping took much longer than I expected. I ordered the engine in Feburary. From what I can tell, Sling shipped out the engine as early as March. But the cargo boat took a long time to arrive, and the shipping company had a mix-up on address when they tried to delivery and caused about another week's delay.

But eventually, it's here. I took a quick check, nothing seem to be bent or broken. The crate and all the small boxes in the crate were intact. I got the engine, fusebox, oil tank, ECU, intercooler. And because I opted for the Rotax extended care, they gave me a Bose A30 heatset!

### Pallet Jack

Next order of business, I need to bring the engine to the hangar. The engine with crate is about 200 lbs. I want to use a small jack to get it onto a truck. So I bought a jack from Amazon ($450), assmebled it and tested lifting the pallet a little bit. It seemed to work. So I will just rent a uhaul proabaly next week and get it done.
